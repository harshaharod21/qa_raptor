Higher demand for agricultural raw material is now anticipated and agriculture is not any more about 
producing farm products and selling them exclusively at the local market."
"Instead farmers today have 
a world market to serve.

But the new chances bring new challenges.

Farmers and agricultural enterprises, willing to be part of the new expanding world market, not only have to take into consideration customers’ preferences whom they want to serve, but also adhere to international trade regulations set by WTO and 
comply with high production and quality standards required by the importing countries.

Agriculture contributes around 17% to GDP and continues to be among the most important and success-
ful sectors in India.

Around 58% of the Indian population depend on agriculture for their livelihood."
"Apart from delivering the local industries with top quality raw materials for processing, agriculture provides 
almost 10% of total export earnings.

However, to support the impressive Indian economic growth in the 
coming years, agriculture will have to contribute more towards value addition, productivity enhancement, high quality products and trained manpower to successfully tackle these challenges.

The states of Gujarat and Maharashtra have competitive advantages for the production of several com-
modities.

However, productivity and competitiveness remains low."
"Rising quality requirements of export and domestic markets require an up-scaling of the production which is only feasible with educated farmers 
and skilled workers.

Desai Fruits and Vegetables (DFV)in cooperation with the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Internationale 
Zusammenarbeit(GIZ) GmbH on behalf of the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and 
Development (BMZ) takes up the existing education gap by implementing a development partnership 
called “Partnership Farming India” ."
"The goal of Partnership Farming India (PFI) is to enable farmers to be self-sufficient decision-makers, 
“agripreneurs” , which allows for a more flexible production system and highlights farming as profession by 
choice and not by inheritance.

Furthermore, PFI strengthens farmers’ and farm workers’ management skills to adopt modern agricul-
tural practices and concepts and enhance the international competitiveness of smallholders’ agricultural 
produce by giving farmers and workers in Gujarat and Maharashtra access to practical agricultural educa-
tion."
"Therefore, DFV and GIZ in close cooperation with the National Institute of Agricultural Extension Management (MANAGE, an organization of Ministry of Agriculture, Government of India) developed the 
training material on basic agricultural knowledge and skills.

The states of Gujarat and Maharashtra will serve as an example on how to establish long term successful 
and trustful business relationships by combining small scale production in the field with large scale pro-cessing and marketing."
"I am confident that this effort will serve the Indian agriculture as a replicable model 
make lasting contributions towards sustainable agriculture and prosperous farmers.

I would like to express my sincere gratitude to the people and institutions namely MANAGE, DFV and 
GIZ,which supported this project and enabled making information available.

This is a useful source of in-formation for farmers, trainers, and other interested persons to improve not only the agriculture but also 
the livelihood of the farming community."

Preface
Agriculture is an important sector of Indian Economy as more than half of its population relies on Ag-
riculture as principle source of income.

Research and Extension systems play major role in generation 
and dissemination of Agricultural technologies aiming at enhancing the income of farmers.

The extension system adopts series of extension methods such as Training, demonstration, exposure visit to transfer the technologies from lab to land."
"Majority of these extension efforts mainly focus on location and crop 
specific technologies, and mostly on solution to problem basis.

However, there is a need for equipping the 
farmers with Basic knowledge of Agriculture in order to create a better knowledge platform at farmer level for taking appropriate farm management decisions and to absorb modern technologies.

In view of this, Desai Fruits and Vegetables Pvt."
"Ltd. (DFV), India, in cooperation with the Deutsche 
Gesellschaft für Internationale Zusammenarbeit (GIZ) GmbH on behalf of the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ) in close cooperation with National Institute of Ag-
ricultural Extension Management (MANAGE- An Organization of Ministry of Agriculture, Government 
of India) brought out Farmer’s Handbook on Basic Agriculture to impart technical knowledge on Basic Agriculture to farmers to provide holistic perspective of scientific Agriculture."
"This handbook is a product of series of brainstorming workshops and consultative meetings with various 
stakeholders such as Researchers, Academicians, Extension Functionaries, Agripreneurs, Master Trainers and Farmers.

Based on the identified needs, the topics were prioritized and contents were developed with 
the help of experts.

The farmer-friendly content has been written in simple language, using more pictures 
with practical examples for the benefit of farmers.

The book contains six chapters, each focusing on a particular topic."
"The first chapter, “General conditions 
for cultivation of crops” , talks about the basic needs of farmers and farming sector, by providing basic knowledge on Good Agricultural Practices (GAP), enhancing the awareness of farmers on critical factors 
in selection of crops and cropping patterns, judicious use of natural resources such as soil and water, and 
emphasizing the importance of mechanization in the field of agriculture."
"The second chapter “Soil and Plant Nutrition” is aimed at increasing the awareness and understanding of 
farmers about soil, it’s structure, physical, chemical, biological properties, soil fertility and managing the soil fertility in an economically and environmentally sustainable manner.

It also focuses on the need for 
soil testing, plant nutrition requirement, organic & inorganic fertilizers, and Integrated Nutrient Manage-
ment (INM) for efficient, economic and sustainable production of crops."
"The third chapter of the book is about Pest Management, and focuses on enhancing the awareness of and 
understanding among farmers about the crop pests, diseases and weed management through Integrated 
Pest Management.

It also aims at sensitizing farmers on safe handling of chemicals and plant protection equipments as also elaborated further in the fifth chapter on “Occupational health and safety of farmers” .

It creates awareness about causes, preventive measures of health hazards, risks & fatalities in agriculture, 
and use of first aid in emergencies."
"It further includes safety tips and care to reduce the risk of injuries and 
fatalities while handling machineries and pesticides by farmers.

Time and resources management is an integral part of each and every activity, be it service sector, busi-
ness or day-to-day activities of life.

Farming sector too has not remained untouched by it.

Therefore, the 
fourth chapter of the book is devoted to “Farm Management” .

It is to educate and equip the farmers tofourth chapter of the book is devoted to “Farm Management” ."
"It is to educate and equip the farmers to 
make proper plans, take appropriate decisions and also to take advantage of the improved technologies to increase production, assure food security for the family and market opportunities to increase income 
considering available resources, anticipated risks, including market fluctuations.

“Farmer’s access to services” , the last chapter of the book, aims at enhancing awareness among farmers 
about sources of extension, information and services, public and private extension services, agricultural 
credit, insurance and legal aspects through Information & Communication Technologies."
"The content is 
useful not only for farmers but also for other stakeholders involved in farm advisory services such as Agri input dealers, Agripreneurs, Kisan Call Centers and extension functionaries working at grass roots level.

We trust that this Handbook will benefit maximum number of farmers to make farming economically and 
environmentally more sustainable.

1Agricultural Universities, Research Institutes, 
Krishi Vigyan Kendras have been generat-
ing ample technologies to improve the productiv-ity and profitability of the farmers.

How many of these technologies are reaching the farmers?"
"Base-line Situation Assessment conducted by Partner -
ship farming in India, in Gujarat and Maharashtra, clearly indicated that farmers with access to techni-cal knowledge on agriculture realized better income compared to others.

Fifty one percent of sample farmers who were part of partnership farming In-dia had knowledge of soil testing compared to only 28% of control group.

Mulching and intercropping as a practice were not widely adopted by control group of farmers.

They were less aware about other organic fertilizers.

Fertigation as a method of appli-cation of fertilizers was not widely practiced by con-trol group."
"Farmers who accessed information from agricultural universities and magazines were less in number in the control group.

The treatment farmers had an average yield of 35.65 tons and control farm-ers had yield of 22.36 tons of banana per acre.

The average net income of the treatment farmers was Rs 93,822 and for the control farmers Rs.81,659.

More than 85% of the farmers wanted basic education on agriculture and crop production and ready to pay for undergoing such basic education and training."
There was a clear interest in the farmers to improve their skill and knowledge and they were ready to pay for the service.The above study clearly indicates that the knowl-edge gap is prevailing among farmers and those who have access to knowledge harvested better profits.
"Increase in productivity and profitability can be 
achieved through:
•	Blending practical knowledge with scientific technologies
•	Efficient use of natural resources
•	Adopting time specific management prac-tices
•	Giving priority for quality driven produc-tion
•	Adopting suitable farming systems 
•	Adoption of location specific technology
•	Market demand driven production 
•	Adopting low cost and no cost technologies1.

Farmers need to answer all the above questions while making decisions for choosing a crop/ 
cropping pattern.

During this decision making pro-cess, farmer cross check the suitability of proposed crop/cropping systems with his existing resources and other conditions.

Thereby, they justify choosing or rejecting a crop/cropping systems."
"This process enables the farmers to undertake a SWOT analysis internally which in turn guides them to take an ap-propriate decision.

1.4.

Climatic factors
Climate and agriculture
•	Monsoon is a key source of water in agriculture
•	Most of our rivers are seasonal fed by the mon-soon; even irrigated agriculture depends on monsoon.

•	Cropping pattern has evolved over years based on climate.

•	Market forces influence cropping patterns in recent times.

Climatic factors and crops 
•	Rainfall drives water availability and deter -
mines sowing time (rainfed crops)."
"•	Temperature drives crop growth, duration and influences milk production in animals.

•	Temperature and relative humidity influence pest and diseases incidence on crops, livestock and poultry.

•	Wet and dry spells cause significant impact on standing crops, physiology, loss of economic products (e.g.

fruit drop).

•	Extreme events (e.g.

high rainfall, floods, heat / cold wave, cyclone, hail, frost) cause enormous losses of standing crops, livestock and fisheries.

Climate and seasons
•	Rainy (June-September) season also known as Kharif, supports most of the rainfed crops (coarse cereals, pulses, oilseeds, etc.)."
"•	Post-rainy (October-February) season also known as Rabi, supports the irrigated or stored moisture grown crops (wheat, mustard, chick-pea, etc.).

•	Summer season (March-May) supports short duration pulses and vegetables.

•	Rabi production is more assured, has a higher yield and reduces pest and disease related prob-lems."
"•	Over time, with irrigation development, the contribution of Kharif is declining and Rabi is increasing.General Conditions for Cultivation of Crops
Farmer’s Handbook on Basic Agriculture
5Climate, cropping pattern and agricul-
tural production issues
•	Cropping patterns based on climate and land 
capability are sustainable but market forces and farmers’ aspirations are forcing unsustainable systems.

•	Farmers must innovate in producing more even from less endowed areas by adopting suitable technologies to cope with changing climate."
"•	Climate change will likely to cause further problems in our crop production and is likely to become the most important environmental issue in the 21st century.

Important agricultural related factors 
responsible for climate change
•	Deforestation and forest degradation
•	Burning of fuel and farm waste
•	Water logged condition
•	Excessive use of external input
•	Large-scale conversion of land for non-agricul-
tural purpose
Impact of climate change in India
•	 Rainfall: No long-term trend noted.

However, regional variations seen, increased summer rainfall and less number of rainy days."
"•	 Temperature : About 0.6 ºC rise in surface tem-
perature during 100 years.

Projected to increase 3.5 to 5 ºC by 2100.

•	 Carbon dioxide: Increasing at the rate of 1.9 ppm per year and expected to reach 550 ppm by 2050 and 700 ppm by 2100.

•	 Extreme events: Increased frequency of heat wave, cold wave, droughts and floods observed during last decade.

•	 Rising sea level: Rise of 2.5 mm/year since 1950.

•	 Glaciers: Rapid melting of the glaciers in the 
Himalayas.

•	 Rainfall distribution: Shift in peak rainfall dis-tribution also noticed in some parts of country."
"Expected impact of climate change on 
agriculture
•	Due to increase in temperature, crop may re-
quire more water.

•	Yield may be reduced in cereal crops especially in Rabi; i.e.

wheat.

General Conditions for Cultivation of Crops
Farmer’s Handbook on Basic Agriculture
Change in pest and disease scenario 
due to climate change
•	 Due to increase in rainfall: Pests like bollworm, 
red hairy caterpillar and leaf spot diseases may increase.Due to increase in temperature: Suck-ing pests such as mites and leaf miner may in-crease."
"•	 Due to variation in rainfall and temperature: Pest and diseases of crops to be altered because of more enhanced pathogen and vector devel-opment, rapid pathogen transmission and in-creased host susceptibility.

Sometimes a minor pest may become a major pest.

•	Agricultural biodiversity is also threatened by decreased rainfall and increased temperature, sea level rise and increased frequency and se-
verity of drought, cyclone and flood.

Quality 
of farm products such as fruits, vegetables, tea, 
coffee, aromatic and medicinal plants may be 
affected."
"Water
•	Demand for irrigation to increase with in-creased temperature and higher amount of evapo-transpiration.

This may result in lower -
ing of groundwater table at some places.

•	The melting of glaciers in the Himalayas will increase water availability in the Ganga, Brah-maputra and their tributaries in the short-run but in the long-run the availability of water will decrease considerably.

•	A significant increase in runoff is projected in the rainy season, however, may not be very ben-eficial unless storage infrastructure could be vastly expanded."
"This extra water in the rainy season, on the other hand, may lead to increase in frequency and duration of floods.

•	The water balance in different parts of India will be disturbed and the quality of ground water along costal track will be more affected due to intrusion of sea water.

Soil
•	Organic matter content, which is already quite low in Indian soil, would become even lower.

Quality of soil organic matter may be affected.

•	Reduction in rate of decomposition and nutri-ent supply."
"•	Increase in soil temperature may reduce Nitro-gen availability due to volatilization and deni-trification.•	Change in rainfall volume and frequency as well as wind may alter the severity, frequency and extent of soil erosion.

•	Rise in sea level may lead to salt water entry in the coastal lands turning them less suitable for conventional agriculture.

Livestock
•	Affect feed production and nutrition of live-stock.

Increased temperature would reduce di-gestibility.

Increased water scarcity would also decrease the food and fodder production."
"•	Major impacts on vector-borne diseases through expansion of vector populations dur -
ing rainy years, leading to large outbreaks of diseases.

•	Increase water, shelter, and energy require-ment of livestock for meeting projected milk demands.

•	Climate change is likely to aggravate heat stress in dairy animals, adversely affecting their re-productive performance.

Fishery
•	Increased sea and river water temperature is likely to affect fish breeding, migration and har -
vest.

•	Impacts of increased temperature and tropical cyclonic activity would affect capture, produc-tion and marketing costs of the marine fish."

"Soil and Water Conservation
Soil and water are our precious heritage.

Hence, 
it is obligatory on our part to protect and hand 
over these resources to further generations.

It is estimated that about 50% of the cultivated area in India suffers from severe soil erosion and requires remedial measures.

•	Water resources are essential for increasing and stabilizing crop production.

•	Wind erosion has been responsible for destroy-ing the valuable top soil.

1.5.1.

Degradation of soil and water 
takes place with water and wind ero-sion
•	The main cause of water erosion is unmanaged 
runoff."
"•	Runoff is the portion of the rainfall or irriga-tion water applied which leaves a field either as surface or as subsurface flow.

Several factors are responsible for runoff 
•	 Climatic factors: Precipitation characteristics - 
duration, intensity, distribution, direction, tem-perature, humidity, wind velocity.

•	 Watershed characteristics: Geological shape of the catchments, size and shape of the catch-ments, topography, drainage pattern.

•	 Barren land without vegetation
•	 Soil types: 
•	 Sandy soil: Average rain – no problem of erosion.

High intensity – More serious of less binding material i.e.

fine soil particle."
"•	 Clay soil: Ordinary rain – more runoff in moderate and steep slopes but high water holding capacity.

•	 Silt loam, loamy and fine sandy loam: More desirable soils from the point of view of 
minimizing soil erosion."
"How vegetation reduces runoff
•	Interception of rainfall
•	Root structure 
•	Biological influences
•	Transpiration effects
•	Intercept, absorb the impact of raindrop
•	Hindrance to runoff water slows down the rate 
at which travels down the slope
•	Knitting and binding effect aggregates the soil into granules 
•	Die and decay increase pore space and water holding capacity
•	One cubic meter of soil has several kilometres of root fibre
•	More vegetative cover, most active soil fauna, channels of earth worm, beetles and other life
•	Vegetation increases the storage capacity of the soil for rainfall by the transpiration of large quantities of moistures from the soil
Soil erosion 
Soil erosion is the detachment and transportation of soil material from one place to another through the action of wind, water in motion or by the hitting action of the rain drops."
"•	When the vegetation is removed and land is put under cultivation the natural equilibrium between soil building and soil removal is dis-turbed.

•	The removal of surface soil takes place at a much faster rate than it can be built up by the soil forming process.

Erosion by water: Known as water erosion, is 
the removal of soil from the lands surface by water in motion.

Sheet erosion: The removal of a thin relatively 
uniform layer of soil particles by the action of rain-fall and runoff."
"•	Extremely harmful
•	Usually so slow that the farmer is not conscious of its existence
•	Common on lands having a gentle uniform slope
•	Results in the uniform removal of the cream of the top soil with every heavy rain
•	Shallow top soil overlies a tight sub soil are most susceptible to sheet erosion
•	Movement of soil by rain drop splash is the pri-mary cause of sheet erosion
•	Sheet erosion has damaged millions of hectares of slopping land throughout the India
Rill erosion is the removal of soil by running wa-
ter with the formation of shallow channels that can be smoothed out completely by normal cultivation."
"•	There is no sharp lines of demarcation where sheet erosion and rill erosion begins but rill erosion is more readily apparent than sheet ero-sion.General Conditions for Cultivation of Crops
Farmer’s Handbook on Basic Agriculture

•	Rills develop when there is a concentration 
of runoff water which, if neglected, grow into large gullies.

•	More serious in soils having a loose shallow top soil.

•	Transition stage between sheet erosion and gul-lying.

Gully erosion: Removal of soil by running wa-
ter with the formation of channels that cannot be smoothed out completely by cultivation.

•	Advance stage of rill erosion."
"•	Any concentration of surface runoff is a poten-tial source of gullying.

•	Cattle paths, cart tracks, dead furrows, tillage furrows or other small depression down a slope favour concentration of flow.

•	Unattended rills deepen and widen every year and begin to attain the form of gullies.

•	Unattended gullies may result over a few years for an entire landscape to be filled with a net-work of gullies.

•	More spectacular than other type of erosions.

Stream channel erosion: Erosion caused by 
stream flow.

•	Closely resembles rill erosion.

•	Intensive channel erosion areas are on the outside of lands where flow shear stresses are high."
"Mass movement: Enmass movement of soil.

•	Landslides, land slips, soil and mudflows are various forms of mass movement.

Wind erosion: Movement of soil particles is 
caused by wind force exerted against or parallel to surface of the ground.

Vegetation and vegetative management
•	Strip cropping
•	Stubble mulching
•	Mulching
Wind erosion management
•	Protect the soil surface with a cover of vegeta-
tion or vegetative residues."
"•	Produce or bring to the surface soil aggregates or clods which are large enough to resist the wind force.

•	Roughen the land surface to reduce wind veloc-ity and trap drifting soil.

•	Establish barriers or trap strips at intervals to reduce wind velocity and soil drifting."
"Best practices to control soil blowing
•	Deep ploughing
•	Summer ploughing
•	Surface roughness
•	Conserving moisture
•	Wind breaks and shelterbelts
•	Mechanical or vegetative barriers
For instance: Shelterbelts for moderating micro-climate•	Shelterbelts reduce wind velocity
•	Moderate temperature
•	Reduce evaporative loss and conserve soil 
moisture
Water erosion can be managed by 
•	In situ water harvesting
•	Summer ploughing
Overland flow management
•	Contour bund
•	Graded bund
•	Broad based bund•	Bench terrace
•	Water harvesting and recycling 
Zero tillage
•	Several practices are in use such as zero till-
age, minimum tillage and direct seeding."
"•	Planting crops in previously untilled soil by opening a narrow slot, trench or band only of sufficient width and depth to obtain seed coverage.

No other soil tillage is done.

Advantages of zero tillage farming•	Erosion control: Retained stubble and crop residue reduces soil erosion and enhances soil fertility
•	Moisture conservation: Stubble traps water, reduce runoff water, better infiltration lead-ing to improved soil moisture condition
•	Higher nitrogen availability
•	Seedling protection: Stubbles protects young seedling from wind and heat
•	Crop yields will be on par with traditional tillage system."
"However good yield can be harvested during dry years
•	Reduce labour and save time
•	Savings on equipment cost
•	Savings on oil/fuel cost
Mulching: Benefits of crop residue mulch-
ing are
•	Increased availability of water and organic 
matter 
•	Less erosion
•	Environment protection
Additional benefit to farmers
•	Less drought susceptibility
•	Improved soil quality and fertilizer efficiency
•	Minimises long term dependency on external inputsGeneral Conditions for Cultivation of Crops

Irrigation
An adequate water supply is important for plant 
growth."
"When rainfall is not sufficient, the 
plants must receive additional water from irriga-tion.

Points consider for irrigation decisions
•	Land suitability for irrigation like slope
•	Effective rainfall: Part of the total rain is useful for crop production
•	When to irrigate: Decide based on soil, crop and climatic condition
•	How much to irrigate: Decide based on crop water requirement 
•	How to irrigate: Select appropriate method for irrigation
•	Quality of irrigation water
1.6.1."
"Various methods can be used to 
supply irrigation water to the plants
•	Surface irrigation: 
•	Basin irrigation
•	Furrow irrigation
•	Sprinkler irrigation 
•	Drip irrigation 
Surface Irrigation
Surface irrigation is the application of water by 
gravity flow to the surface of the field.

•	Either the entire field is flooded (Basin Irriga-tion) or the water is fed into small channels (furrows) or strips of land (borders).

Basin Irrigation
•	Basins are flat areas of land, surrounded by low bunds.

•	The bunds prevent the water from flowing to the adjacent fields."
"•	Basin irrigation is commonly used for rice grown on flat lands or in terraces on hill-sides.

Paddy grows best when its roots are submerged in water.

Hence, basin irrigation is the best method to use for this kind of crop.

•	Trees can also be grown in basins, where one tree is usually located in the middle of a small basin.

•	In general, the basin method is suitable for crops that are no affected by standing in water for longer periods.

•	Basin irrigation is suitable for many field crops."
"•	Crops suitable for basin irrigation include pastures, citrus, banana and crops that are broadcasted such as cereals and to some extent row crops such as tobacco.

•	Basin irrigation is generally not suited to crops, which cannot stand in wet or water -
logged conditions for periods longer than 24 hours; eg: potatoes, beet root and carrots 
•	The flatter the land surface, the easier it is to construct basins.

•	It is also possible to construct basins on sloping land, even when the slope is quite steep.

Level basins, called terraces, can be constructed like the steps of a staircase."
"•	Soils suitable for basin irrigation depend on the crop grown."
"Basin should be small if the:•	Slope of the land is steep
•	Soil is sandy
•	Stream size to the basin is small
•	Required depth of the irrigation application is small
•	Field preparation is done by hand or animal power
Basin can be large if the:•	Slope of the land is gentle or flat
•	Soil is clay
•	Stream size to the basin is large
•	Required depth of the irrigation application is large
•	Field preparation is mechanized
•	The land slope, the soil type, the available stream size, the required depth of the ir -
rigation application and farming practices mainly determine the shape and size of basins
•	If the land slope is steep, the basin should be narrow; otherwise too much earth move-ment will be needed to obtain level basins."
"•	Three other factors, which may affect basin width, are depth of fertile soil, method of basin construction, agricultural practices.

•	 There are two methods to supply irrigation water to basins: (i) The direct method: Ir -
rigation water is led directly from the field channel into the basin through siphons,14
General Conditions for Cultivation of Crops
Farmer’s Handbook on Basic Agriculture
or bund breaks.

(ii) The cascade method: 
irrigation water is supplied to the highest terrace, and then allowed to flow to a lower terrace and so on.

Maintenance of basins•	Bunds are susceptible to erosion."
"This may be caused by, for example, rainfall, flood or the passing of people when used as foot-paths.

•	Rats may dig holes in the sides of the bunds.

•	Therefore, it is important to check the bunds regularly, notice defects and repair them instantly, before greater damage is done.

Advantages of basin irrigation•	Conservation of rainfall and reduction in soil erosion.

•	High water application and distribution ef-ficiencies.

•	Useful in leaching of salts.

•	Suitable to all close growing crops, row crops and orchards.

Furrow irrigation
•	Furrows are small channels, which carry water down the land slope between the crop rows."
"•	Water infiltrates into the soil as it moves along the slope.

•	The crop is usually grown on the ridges be-tween the furrows.

•	This method is suitable for all row crops and for crops that cannot stand in water for long peri-ods.

Crops such as maize, sunflower, sugarcane, and soybean can be irrigated by furrow irriga-tion.

•	Crops that would be damaged by inundation, such as tomatoes, vegetables, potatoes, beans; fruit trees like citrus and grape as well as broad-casted crops like wheat.•	Irrigation water flows from the field channel into the furrows by opening up the bank of the channel or by means of siphons or spiles."
"•	Furrows must be on consonance with the slope, soil type, stream size, irrigation depth, cultiva-tion practice and field length.

•	Uniform flat or gentle slopes are preferred for furrow irrigation.

•	On undulating land, furrows should follow the land contours.

Advantages of furrow irrigation•	Suitable for row crops and vegetables.

•	Suitable for soils in which the infiltration rates vary between 0.5 and 2.5 cm/hr.

•	Ideal for slopes varying from 0.2 to 0.5 per cent and a stream size of 1-2 liters/sec.

•	In areas requiring surface drainage or prone to temporary water logging, furrows are very effective."
"•	In areas where water for irrigation purposes.

is scarce, the practice of alternate or skip furrow irrigation can save considerable quantity of water without significantly af-fecting yields.

Sprinkler irrigation
Water is pumped through a pipe system and then sprayed onto the crops through sprinkler heads."
"Advantages•	Water conservation
•	Soil conservation 
•	Efficient use of water
•	Saving of labour
•	Early seed germination
•	Fertigations
•	Soil amendments

"Seed 
A ’seed’ (in some plants, referred to as a ‘kernel’) 
is a small embryonic ’plant’ enclosed in a cov-
ering called the seed coat, usually with some ‘stored food’ .

Seeds fundamentally are a means of repro-duction and most seeds are the product of ‘sexual reproduction’ , which remixes genetic material and ‘phenotype variability’ that ‘natural selection’ acts upon.

The seed is the basic input in agriculture upon 
which other inputs are applied.

A good vigorous seed utilizes all the resources and realizes a reason-able output to the grower.

It is wealth to the farmer since yesterday’s harvest is tomorrow’s hope."
"Good seed in good soil realizes a good yield.

Moreover, it is the link between two generations."

Seed treatment
Seed treatment is usages of specific products and spe-
cific techniques to improve the growth environment for the seed, seedlings and young plants.

It ranges from a basic dressing to coating and pelleting.

Seed dressing: This is the most common method 
of seed treatment."
"The seed is dressed with either a dry formulation or wet treated with a slurry or liq-uid formulation.

Dressings can be applied at both, the farm and industries.

Low cost earthen pots can be used for mixing pesticides with seed or seed can be spread on a polythene sheet.

The required quan-tity of chemical can be sprinkled on the seed lot and mixed mechanically by the farmers.

Seed coating: A special binder is used with a for -
mulation to enhance adherence to the seed.

Seed pelleting: The most sophisticated Seed 
Treatment Technology changes the physical shape of a seed to enhance pelletability and handling."
"Pel-leting requires specialized application machinery and techniques and is the most expensive applica-tion.

The farmer must take care of the fol-
lowing while buying the seeds
•	When purchasing the seed farmer should ob-
tain a bill/cash memo wherein the lot number and seed tag number is mentioned.

•	After purchasing the seed, empty bag/packet (pouches) and receipt should be kept safely.

•	Out of purchased seed, 100 seeds are taken from each purchased variety to test them for germi-nation before sowing in the field.

Knowing the germination percentage, the farmer can decide the seed rate when sowing in the field."

Cropping systems
Farmers resort to cultivation of a number of crops 
and rotate particular crop combinations.

More 
than 250 cropping systems are being followed in In-dia, of which 30 cropping systems are more preva-lent.

Some of the important cropping systems are:
1."
"Sequential cropping system: 
Growing crops in sequence within a crop year, one crop being sown after the harvest of the other.

For example, rice followed by pigeonpea, pigeonpea fol-lowed by wheat.

2.

Intercropping System: 
Growing more than one crop in the same area in rows of definite proportion and pattern.

The following intercropping practices 
were found to be remunerative in India’s groundnut growing states."
"State Crop combination
 Maharashtra Groundnut + Red gram (6:1/4:1)
Groundnut + Soybean (6:2)
Groundnut + Sunflower (6:2/3:1)
 Gujarat Groundnut + Castor (9:2/3:1)
Groundnut + Sunflower (3:1/2:1)Groundnut + Red gram (4:1)Alley cropping 
Is an agroforestry practice in which perennial, pref-
erably leguminous, trees or shrubs are grown simul-taneously with an arable crop.

The trees, managed as hedgerows, are grown in wide rows and the crop is planted in the interspace or ‘alley’ between the tree rows.

During the cropping phase, the trees are pruned."
"Prunings are used as green manure or mulch on the crop to improve the organic matter status of the soil and to provide nutrients, particularly nitrogen, to the crop.

"Good Agricultural Practices 
(GAP)
Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) are ""prac -
tices that address environmental, economic and 
social sustainability for on-farm processes, and which 
result in safe and quality food and non-food agricul-tural products"".

What are GAP codes, standards and 
regulations?

Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) codes, stand-
ards and regulations are guidelines which have been developed in recent years by the food industry, producers' organizations, governments and NGOs aiming to codify agricultural practices at farm level for a range of commodities.

Why do GAP codes, standards and 
regulations exist?"
"These GAP codes, programmes or standards exist 
because of: 
•	Growing concerns about food quality and safe-ty worldwide.

•	Fulfilment of trade and government regulatory requirements.

•	Specific requirements especially for niche mar -
kets.

Objectives
•	Ensuring safety and quality of produce in the food chain.

•	Capturing new market advantages by modify-ing supply chain governance.

•	Improving natural resources used, workers' health and working conditions to creating new market opportunities for farmers and exporters in developing countries."
"The benefits of GAP codes 
•	Standards and regulations are numerous, in-cluding food quality and safety improvement.

•	Facilitation of market access.

•	Reduction in non-compliance risks regarding permitted pesticides, Maximum Residue Limits (MRLs) and other contamination hazards.

GAP related to crop protection 
•	Use resistant cultivars and varieties.

•	Crop sequences, associations and cultural prac-tices.

•	Biological prevention of pests and diseases.

•	Maintain regular and quantitative assessment of the balance status between pests and diseases and beneficial organisms of all crops."
"•	Adopt organic control practices where and when applicable.

•	Apply pest and disease forecasting techniques where available.

•	Determine interventions following considera-tion of all possible methods and their short and long-term effects on farm productivity and en-vironmental implications.

This will allow the minimizing of agrochemicals, in particular, to promote Integrated Pest Management (IPM).

•	Store and use agrochemicals according to le-gal requirements of registration for individual crops, rates, timings, and pre-harvest intervals
•	Ensure that agrochemicals are only applied by specially trained and knowledgeable persons."
"•	Ensure that equipment used for the handling and application of agrochemicals complies with established safety and maintenance standards.

•	Maintain accurate records of agrochemical use.

•	Identify the GAP in each protection method.

Crop rotation systems 
•	Sequence crops by selecting pest host relation.

•	Selected crop for rotation in order to break the life cycle of pest (Jowar should be rotated with pulses to combat striga weed).

•	The selected crop for rotation should not be the food of previous crop pest."
"•	To select appropriate crops for rotation:
•	Analyze the pest habitat
•	Follow forecasts
•	Monitor pest and natural enemies
Privilege resistant species 
•	Cultivate plant varieties which are less prone to pest attack.

•	The resistant varieties reduce production cost.

•	Pest resistant transgenic crops developed for specific pest can be used."
"This is new avenue for reducing pesticide load.General Conditions for Cultivation of Crops

"Monitoring of performance through taking 
notes each year/season.

•	Keep the pest management record along with season, weather and other agriculture activity.

•	Document the pest load and control achieved
•	Use this experience for future planning.

Precision farming: Use precision farming mod-
ules and apply Information Technology (IT) to economize and for effective monitoring.

Good Agriculture Practices help the farmers to make 
use of the opportunities available in International Markets for selling their products and realising bet-ter farm profits.1.10.

Lessons Learnt

"Critical factors to be considered while de-ciding the crops and cropping pattern are climatic factors, soil conservation, water, cropping system options, past and present experiences of farmers, expected profit and risk, economic conditions of farmers including land holding, labour availability, mechanization potential technology avail-ability and suitability, demand and avail-ability of market policies and schemes, public and private extension influence, availability of required agricultural inputs including agricultural credit and post har -
vest storage and processing technologies.

2."
"Soil, water and wind erosion may be man-aged through various recommended prac-tices.

3.

Method of irrigation has to be decided considering the quantity of water available and crop to be grown.

4.

Recommended certified seeds may be used.

5.

Mechanisation enhances quality of agri-cultural operations and minimises the cost and dependence on labour.

"What is Soil?

Soil is a thin layer of earth’s crust, which serves as natural medium for the growth of plants.

Rocks 
are the important sources for the parent materials over which soils are developed.

Soil Constituents 
Soil is a dynamic medium made up of minerals, or -
ganic matter, water, air and living creatures includ-ing bacteria and earthworms.

It was formed and is forever changing due to 5 major physical factors: parent material, time, climate, or -
ganisms present and topography.

The way in which 
we manage soil is another major factor influencing the character of the soil."

Soil colour
•	Dark colour indicates usually medium to high 
fertility due to high amount of organic matter.

These soils have usually high amount of nutri-ents, good water holding capacity and structure and are well aerated.

•	Light colour indicates medium to low fertil-ity.

These soils may have leaching issue (water makes organic matter and other nutrients move downward faster)."
"Soil depth
•	The depth of soil to which the roots of a plant can readily penetrate to in order to reach water and nutrients.

•	Minimum of 3-5 feet is desirable, deeper soils are better because they can hold more nutrients and water.

Soil texture
•	Texture refers to relative proportion of miner -
al particles (sand, silt, and clay) in soil.

Many 
properties of soils; e.g.

drainage, water holding capacity, aeration and the nutrient availability; depend largely on soil texture.

•	 Sandy: Low fertility and water holding capacity but good aeration.

•	 Loamy:  Medium fertility and good aeration."
"•	 Clayey:  High fertility and poor aeration, hard 
to plough.

•	Farmers may refer to their soil as heavy or light, illustrating the ease of working.

The heavy soils are usually hard to plough and require much more effort than light soils.

Organic matter may be added to improve the soil texture."

35Soil pH
•	Soil pH is of utmost importance in plant growth 
as it influences nutrient availability, toxicities and the activity of soil organisms.Tips for soil pH management
•	Acid soils are to be corrected by using lime, quantity of lime application is as per soil test report.

•	Alkali soils are to be corrected by gypsum/sul-phur, quantity of application is as per soil test report.

•	Saline – alkali soils should be treated with gyp-sum and improved drainage."
"Soil organic matter
•	Soil organic matter is the mix of plant and ani-mal matter in different stages of decay.

•	Soil organic matter plays a key role in biologi-cal, physical, and chemical function in soil."
"Soil organic matter helps by:
•	Providing nutrients for soil organisms
•	Acting as major reservoir of plant nutrients
•	Making nutrient exchange between soil and root of the plants easier
•	Improving soil structure
•	Influencing soil temperature
•	Reducing the risk of soil erosion
•	Increasing water holding capacity
Soil organic matter can be improved 
through:
•	Recycling the crop residue back to field 
without wasting and burning
•	Applying compost

Carbon - Nitrogen Ratio (C:N Ratio)
There are chemical elements in the organic matter, 
which are extremely important, especially in their relation or proportion to each other."
"They are Car -
bon and Nitrogen.

The relationship is called Car -
bon - Nitrogen Ratio (C:N Ratio).

For example, composed manure has 20:1 and sawdust has 400:1 of carbon and nitrogen.

Generally speaking, the legumes are highest in nitrogen and have low C:N Ratio, which is highly desirable.

Farmers can use blood meal, bone meal, poultry manure, cottonseed meal and soybean meal and other nitrogen rich ma-terial as organic matter, which enhance the decom-position.

Electrical Conductivity (EC): EC is normally consid-
ered to be a measurement of the dissolved salts in a solution."
"General interpretation of EC values 
Through application of zypsum, the saline/sodic soils can be amended.

The quantity of zypsum to be applied is decided by EC value.

Farmers having problem of saline/sodic soils can go for soil testing and approach extension officials for further guid-ance.

Soil fertility
•	Soil fertility is generally defined as “ability of soil to supply plant nutrients” .

Soil structure, soil texture, temperature, water, light and air also play an important role in maintaining soil fertility."
"•	Plant nutrients which are often scarce in soil are nitrogen, potassium and phosphorus since plants use large amounts for their growth and survival.

•	Important nutrients, their function and defi-ciency symptoms are described below.Effect of Soil pH on Nutrient Availability

"Soil Analysis: Key to a Successful 
Nutrient Management Plan
Higher crop yields and quality of 
the crops depend largely on the ef-
ficient supply of nutrients.

Soil provides not only the medium but also functions as the source of these nutrients for the plants.

Soil resources get depleted with every harvest and need to be replenished for every crop.

However, one must know which nutrients are to what extent deplet-ed and what addition of fertilizers should be planned accordingly.

Soil analysis, in this regard, helps in determining the level of nutrients and in deciding the required amount of fertilizer application."
"Accuracy of soil analysis is directly relat-
ed to the quality of the soil sample taken.

Application of appropriate fertilizers with the proper nutrient mix will help not only to increase the productivity and farm in-come but also provide a more realistic chance to obtain the desired yield.

There are various methods for taking a soil sam-ple from a field.

The right method of sam-pling may be decided by consulting local extension officer or your DESAI-trainer.

"Plant Analysis
Plant Analysis is the second tool, after soil test-
ing that is critical to improve crop nutrition and 
yield.

Only plant analysis can identify the actual nutrient status of a plant or crop.

While soil testing identifies the nutrients offered to the crop or plants, Plant analysis identifies how well the plants utilizes the soil nutrients and applied nutrients.

Plant analy-sis allows the plant to tell us what nutrients it needs.

It is critical that the correct plant part and stage of 
growth be sampled.

The normal nutrient concentra-tion differs between the various plant parts."
"Also, the normal nutrient concentration of each plant part changes as the plant matures.

It is important to keep these factors in mind to assess the nutrients status of plants.

The plant parts required to be col-lected for different crops are as follows.

Crop Growth stage Plant part to be sampled Quantity
Cotton (a) Seedling, 6” to 12” 
tall
(b) Prior to or at first 
bloom

C. Irrigation Water Analysis
Irrigation water, irrespective of its source, always contains some soluble salts.

The suitability of wa-
ters for a specific purpose depends upon the types and amounts of dissolved salts."
"Some of the dis-solved salts or other constituents may be useful for crops but the quality or suitability of water for irri-gation purposes is assessed in terms of the presence of undesirable constituents.

Some of the dissolved ions such as NO3 are useful for crops.

The most important characteristic that de-
termine the quality of irrigation water are:
•	pH
•	Total concentration of soluble salts are judged through Electrical Conductivity (EC).

•	Relative proportion of sodium to other cations 
such as Ca and Mg are referred to as      Sodium Adsorption Ratio (SAR).

•	Concentration of boron or other elements that may be toxic to plants."
"•	Concentration of carbonates and bi-carbonate as related to the concentration of calcium plus magnesium are referred to as Residual Sodium Carbonate (RSC).

•	Content of anions such as chloride, sulphate and nitrate.

Methods of water sample collection
As water quality and suitability plays an important role in deciding production and productivity of crops, farmers are advised consult extension worker to test the water.

Nutrient re-quirement and productivity
Keeping soil 
fertility and soil nutrients at optimum level helps in-creasing the productiv -
ity of the soil."
"Although the ability of the soil to supply the plants with the required 
nutrients depends also on the soil condition like i.e.

soil texture, soil structure and soil organic matter.

Therefore, soil fertility management does not only include nutrient management but also soil condi-tion management.

Apart from other soil management practices, 
soil fertility focuses on:
•	Maintain a balance between nutrient uptake 
and nutrient application.

•	Adequate fertility for the plants at the specific growth stages."
"•	Soil fertility and organic matter maintenance
•	Minimizing the nutrient loss by avoiding excess application.46
Soil and Plant Nutrition
Farmer’s Handbook on Basic Agriculture
The soil nutrient demand usually is based on:
•	Soil nutrient level
•	Crop variety and yielding ability
•	Soil moisture
•	Targeted yield
Soil analysis direct the farmer on quantity and qual-
ity of fertilisers to be used.

Farmers can get the crop specific nutrient (fertilizer) recommendations af-ter consulting the local extension service or their DESAI-trainer and discussing with them the soil analysis report."
"C. Recommended Fertilizer Dose for 
Important CropsGeneral considerations before fertilizer applica-
tion:
•	Nutrients and not fertilizers should be bought.

(Think nutrients, not fertilizers).

•	Each nutrient applied as fertilizer should give a desired production response.

•	The cost of fertilization must be calculated on the basis of applied plant nutrients per unit area of land.

•	Calculate one nutrient at a time, considering 
available sources, prices and feasibility of using."
"•	A sample Soil Health Card, issued to the farm-
ers based on the soil test results, should be used by the farmer to calculate the quantities of fer -
tilizers required:

•	Over supply makes plant tissues soft and vul-nerable to diseases and pathogens.

•	Increased rate of soil organic matter decompo-sition resulting in soil degradation."
"•	Many nutrients applied are easily lost through different chemical reactions.

Organic fertilizers
Advantages:
•	Balanced nutrient supply.

•	Enhance the soil biological activity.

•	Help in improving soil structure.

•	Increase the organic matter content.

•	Slow release of nutrients makes soil on the long run fertile.

•	Help in combating plant diseases.

Disadvantages
•	Low nutrient content.

•	Only effective in the long run.

•	It may not supply all the nutrients required for plant growth.

•	High cost.

•	Bulkiness.

Efficient fertilizer use
Good knowledge and management practices can improve the fertilizer use efficiency."
"•	Select the crops and varieties that suit the local-ity and have best fertilizer response.

•	Select right kind of fertilizer according to crop and soil.

•	The fertilization should be planned for the cropping pattern and not for single crops.

•	Fertilization application rate should be decided only after discussing your soil analysis report with your local extension officer or Desai-Trainer.

•	Balanced fertilization should be practiced.

•	Crops should only be sown at the locally rec-ommended periods.

•	Maintain optimum plant population and prop-er plant spacing."
"•	Effective control of pests and diseases will help in maximizing the fertilizer efficiency.

•	To maximize the yield increase through ferti-lizer, all other growth critical factors must also be optimum e.g.

crop must be irrigated at criti-cal growth stages.Fertilizer application methods
Broadcasting: fertilizer is distributed manually 
over the cropped field.

•	The most common fertilizer application method.

•	Highly inefficient method
•	High economic and nutrient losses
Placement: application in band or packets near

Method of application and nutrients
The method of application should be chosen ac-
cording to the nutrient, crop, soil and cultivation method.

•	 Nitrogen  application should be applied in splits 
and slow release mode to minimize loss.

•	Frequent application in small quantity through foliar application is most efficient and results in quick recovery of crops.•	Use slow release nitrogen for plantation crops and long duration crops.

•	Under puddle condition, use coated urea-neem oil."
"Coal tar sulphur coating will make urea to release nitrogen slow to match the uptake pat-tern.

•	Urea can be cured with soil (1 part urea with 5-10 parts soil) to reduce the losses.

•	Phosphate should be placed 4 to 6 cm below and 4 to 6 cm away from the seeds to ensure maximum availability.

•	Phosphatic fertilizers give better response when placed in bands near the plant rows.

•	Potassic fertilizers can be applied in one dose as basal application but for long duration crops the fertilizer application may be done in 2 to 3 splits."
"Fertilizer calculations
Here is an example for the application of fertilizers based on the soil test recommendations.

Suppose the recommendations are 120 kg N, 60 Kg P and 40 Kg K per ha.

Calculate the quantity of urea, super -
phosphate and muriate of potash fertilizers needed to supply the recommended doses!

Urea content is 46%, so to supply 46 kg N/ha 
100 kg urea is required.

To supply 120 kg N/ha 100/46*120=260.9 or 261 kg urea is required.

Simi-larly super phosphate content is 16% P2O5 and the recommendation is given in the form of Phospho-rous."
"•	% P  = %P2O5 X 0.44
•	Kg P = kg P2O5 X 0.44
•	Kg P = 16 X 0.44
•	Kg P = 7.04
So super phosphate contains 7.04 P and the recom-mendation is given as 60 kg P .

To supply 60 kg P=100/7.04*60=852.27 or 852 kg 
single super phosphate is required.

Similarly, we have to calculate the dose of potash through Muri-ate of Potash (MOP) as MOP contains 60% K2O.

So MOP contains 49.8 K and the recommendation 
given is 40 kg K/ha.

To supply 40 kg K=100/49.8*40=80.3 kg or 80 kg MOP is required.

So based on fertilizer analysis and soil test information the fertilizer application rates are calculated as above."

Example - 1
1.

Urea with 46% N costs Rs.562.20 per 100 kg.

2.

Ammonium sulphate 20% N costs Rs.1029 per 100 kg.

Urea has 46% N i.e.

46 kg N in every 100 kg urea.

Therefore unit value of N in urea: 562.2/46= Rs.12.22 per kg N. Ammonium sulphate has 20.6% N i.e."
"20 kg N in every 100 kg fertilizer and 24% sulphur.

Therefore unit value of N in ammonium sulphate: 1029/20.6= Rs.49.95 per kg N. Thus, the nitrogen is cheaper in urea.

Y et, ammonium sulphate also has 24% sulphur in it.Therefore, for soils with sulphur deficiency, am-monium sulphate is a better choice and for soils with normal sulphur levels, urea presents a better N source.

Example - 2
1.

Single Super Phosphate (SSP) with 7 % P 
costs Rs.480 per 100 kg.

2.

Di - Ammonium Phosphate (DAP) 20% P and 18% N costs Rs.1596 per 100 kg.

SSP has 7% P i.e.

7 kg P in every 100 kg SSP ."
"There-fore unit value of P in SSP: 480/7= Rs.68.57 per kg P .

Whereas, DAP has 20% P and 18% N, i.e.

20 kg P 
and 18 kg of N in every 100 kg of DAP .

Cost of Nitrogen in 100 kg of DAP = (18 X 12.22 ) = 
Rs.219.96.

Therefore unit value of P in DAP: (1596 – 219.96 = 1376.00); i.e.

1376/20=  Rs.68.80 per kg P
Thus, the unit cost of P is the same in both the ferti-
lisers.

Y et, DAP also has 18% N in it.

Therefore, for soils with nitrogen requirement, DAP is the better choice.

Organic fertilizers
Organic manures are natural p roducts used to pro-
vide the nutrients to crops.

Examples of organic 
manure are cow dung, farmyard manure, green ma-
nure, compost from crop residues, vermicompost and other biological waste."
"Organic manures increase the organic matter in the 
soil.

Organic matter in turn releases the plant food in available form for the use of crops.

However, or -
ganic manures should not be seen only as carriers of plant food.

These manures also enable a soil to hold more water and also help to improve the drainage 
in clay soils.

They provide organic acids that help to 
dissolve soil nutrients and make them available for the plants.

Additionally, organic manures have low nutrient 
content and, therefore, need to be applied in large 
quantities."
"For example, to get a standard mixture 
of 25 kg NPK, almost 1000-2000 kg organic manure is required, whereas the same amount of NPK can 
be easily obtained with a 50 kg ba g of NPK fertilizer.

Compost: Compost is well decomposed organic 
wastes like plant residues, animal dung and urine earth from cattle sheds, waste fodder, etc."
"Tips for FYM preparation
•	Provide s hade to compost site
•	Make compost pit in a well drained elevated 
place
•	Smaller heaps of manageable shape are better
•	Keep the pit free from weeds
•	Pit should be near to cattle shed and water 
source
•	Allowing for full maturity
•	Also use urine 
•	If ash is added do not heap in the pit but spread uniformly
How to use
•	Manure shou ld not be kept exposed in the field 
before application
•	Preferably apply in bands into the soil instead of broadcast."
"In case broadcast, work it into the 
soil immedia tely
Advantage
•	Complete plant nutrient
•	Improved soil structure increases soil aeration and drainability
•	Organic matter acts as biological clay and in-crease nutrient and water holding capacity of soil•	It reduces the bulk density to desirable level (1.3g/cc)
•	It provides enough food for micro organisms in the soil and helps to build up microorganisms in the soil
•	Nutrients slow release nature is very useful for long duration and plantation crops
Disadvantage
•	It is bulky
•	Cost of handling, transportation and storage are high
•	High labour input
•	High cost per kg of nutrients
Vermi-Compost: Vermi-composting is a process 
by which earthworms convert organic waste into fertile manure."
"Important spp of earthworm used for vermicomposting in Indian conditions are Epi-geic Eugeniae, Eisenia Foetida, and Perionyx Exca-vatus.

Earthworms
•	Feed on soil and soil organic matter and con-
vert it into compost
•	Encourage growth of useful micro organisms
•	Aerate and pulverize the soil
•	Make soil porous and improving drainage
•	Increasing water holding capacity of soil
•	Give strength to plant immunity system
Advantages of vermi-compost
•	Easy to use
•	Low cost to produce
•	Convert organic matter in to good manure in short time
How to make it
•	Enrich vermi-compost with bio-agents 
•	Earthworms are our friends."
"Protect them and nurture in the field
Green manures
•	Select important species
•	Find a season to fit the green manuring crop in to cropping system
•	Incorporate when 45 days old
•	Allow 15-20 days before next planting for de-composition
Example: Sunhemp and Daincha
Green leaf manure
•	Grow leguminous trees on road side, on bunds and waste landSoil and Plant Nutrition
Farmer’s Handbook on Basic Agriculture
51•	Loppings of trees can be incorporated 15 days 
before planting
•	Provide approximately 5 to 10 tons
Example: Pongamia and Neem 
Oilcakes
•	Concentrated organic matter
•	Mix with chemical fertilizer is useful as they make fertilizer slow release
•	Use to enrich compost/organics
•	Use preferably non edible oil cakes
Liquid Fertilisers
•	Liquid form of fertilizers are applied with irri-gation water or for direct application through foliar spray to augment yield and improve qual-ity of a variety of crops like fruits, vegetables, oil seeds, pulses, cereals, cotton, tobacco, sug-arcane, tea, etc."
"•	It will ease handling, less labour requirement as well as the possibility of mixing with herbicides have made the liquid fertilisers more acceptable to farmers
Fertigation
•	Fertigation is the judicious application of ferti-lizers by combining it with irrigation water
•	Fertigation can be achieved through fertilizer tank, venturi system, injector pump, Non-Elec-tric Proportional Liquid Dispenser (NEPLD) and automated system
Advantages of Fertigation
•	Ensures a regular flow of water as well as , re-sulting in increased growth rates for higher yields
•	Offers greater versatility in the timing of the nutrient application to meet specific crop de-mands
•	Improves availability of nutrients and their up-take by the roots
•	Safer application method which eliminates the danger of burning the plant root system
•	Offers simpler and more convenient applica-tion than soil application of fertilizer, thus, sav-ing time, labour, equipment and energy
•	Improves fertilizer use efficiency
•	Reduction of soil compaction and mechanical damage to the crops
•	Potential reduction of environmental contami-nation
•	Convenient use of compound and ready-mix nutrient solutions which also contain a small concentration of micronutrients

Bio-Fertilizers
These are products of microbial origin containing live cells of micro organisms multiplied in a labo-ratory and mixed with a carrier material like finely powdered coal, lignite or humus and supplied in a solid form.

Basically two types of bio fertilizer distinguished 
based on their capacity to supply nitrogen or phos-phorus.

Some bio-fertilizers have the capacity to supply nitrogen because they have the capacity to absorb nitrogen gas from the atmosphere in asso-ciation with plants and use the nutrient for their cell synthesis."
"The nitrogen fixed becomes available to crop plants after the plant material is incorporated in to soil.

This process is known as symbiotic nitro-gen fixation.

Other nitrogen fixing organisms can live freely in soil and fix nitrogen.

There is one more type where the organism establishes a weak or as-sociative symbiosis and fixes nitrogen.

In addition to nitrogen fixers there are some bacte-
ria and fungi, which are used as bio-fertilizers to en-hance phosphorus supply to crops."
"They solubilize insoluble or difficulty soluble phosphorus through their capacity to produce organic acids.52

Azolla is a water fern which establishes a very active and ben-eficial association with blue-green algae - Anabaena Algal inoculants are cultivated on submerged soils in tanks, dried and supplied as soil based culture (Inoculants).

Endomycorrhizal inoculants are sup-plied as pieces of roots of grass plants infected with mycorrhizae.

Ectomycorrihizal inoculants are culti-vated in the laboratory and mixed with carrier ma-terial for supply.

Azolla are supplied as fresh fronds (leaf)."
"The bio-fertilizers are inoculated to seeds or applied directly to soil after suspending them in wa-ter.

Package of Practices – Banana
Banana is one of the most commonly grown fruit crop of the country.

India produces about 
26.217 MT of banana from an area of 0.709 Mha with an average productivity of 37.0 mt/ha.

Major producing states are Tamil Nadu, Maharashtra, Karnataka, Gujarat, Andhra Pradesh, As-sam and Madhya Pradesh."
"Tamil Nadu has 0.1244 mha under banana and the total production during 2008-09 is 6.667 Mmt with 53.6 mt/ha productivity.

In Gujarat, banana crop is cultivated in 11 districts covering an area of about 60900 ha.

Gujarat is ranking 3rd among the states of India with an average productivity of 58.7t/ha.

Unripe fruits are used for making chips, vegetable flour, etc.

Ripened fruits are used for preparing drink, jam, beer, salad, etc.

Banana fruits are having numerous medicinal uses (as per Ayurveda).

From psedostem threads are obtained and used for making rope and cloths."
"Prevailing Varieties: Basarai, Lokhandi, Robasta, Shreemanti and Grand Naine.

Climate: Banana grows well in warm and humid climate with an average temperature of 27oC 
and rainfall of 2,000 to 2,500 mm.

However, it requires assured irrigation facility.

Soil type suitability: Loamy and salty clay loam soils with good fertility status are best suited 
for banana cultivation.

However, extremely clayey and sandy soils are not suitable for banana crop.

Land preparation: The land should be ploughed, harrowed and planked to achieve levelled 
fields."
"For planting banana, dugout a pit of 30 x 30 x 30 cm size at a spacing of 1.5 x 1.5 m.
Soil sterilization: After land preparation, the pits should be exposed to the sunlight for 10 to 
15 days.

In the case of heavy infestation of soil born pest and diseases, the soil solarization should be done using transparent plastic for a period of 15 to 20 days during summer season (preferably during May).

Time of plating: Optimum time for planting is 15th June to 15th July.

Banana planting is done 
either by suckers or tissue culture plant.

Suckers: Suckers should be selected from a healthy field of banana."
"Sufficient care should be 
taken that suckers should not be damaged during digging and transport.

Fresh sucker, weighing about 500 to 1,500 g, should be selected.

For control of fungal diseases, suckers should be dipped in a solution of aurofugine
1 (10 g / 100 litres of water) for 1.5 hour prior to planting.

Tissue culture plant: Select healthy and uniform plants.

Irrigation and scheduling: The water requirement of banana crop by surface method of ir -
rigation (25-30 irrigations) is 1,500-1,800 mm.

By drip irrigation method, water requirement is 900-1,080 mm."
The drip system should be operated on alternate day for a period of 1.05 to 2.25 hours during winter and 2.5 to 2.75 hrs during summer at a pressure of 1.2 kg/cm2.

For using water-soluble fertilizers, the following schedule of fertigation may be followed:
Nutrient Fertilizer application schedule
N (180g/plant) 7 to 8 splits at an interval of 15 to 20 
days.

P (72g/plant) 7 to 8 splits at an interval of 15 to 20 days.

K (180g/plant) 7 to 8 splits at an interval of 15 to 20 days.

Time of application: The total quantities of water-soluble fertilizers should be applied in 7 to 8 
splits at an interval of 15 to 20 days."
"The first split should be applied at the time of planting before monsoon and the rest should be applied after the cessation of monsoon.

Weeding: Banana fields should be kept weed free either by hand weeding/interculturing or by 
weedicide (diuron @ 1.2 kg/ha as pre emergence) application.

Mulching with black plastic (50 mi-cron) or sugarcane trash (@ 10 t/ha) should be done.

If required, hand weeding should be done prior to mulching.

Desuckering: First desuckering should be done manually.

To minimize the regeneration of suck-
ers, 3 ml of diesel or kerosene should be injected into the cut portion of the suckers."

Rhizome weevil and nematode Neem based products such as Neem oil, Neem cake, Neem seed Kernal extract (NSKE) can be applied.

Bunch coverage: After the complete formation of the bunch, it should be covered by LLDP film 
bag (blue, white or black colour)."
"This improves quality as well as yield of banana.

Time of harvesting: Maturity varies with variety but usually the crop takes about 12-14 months 
to mature.

Yield: By adopting the above practices, the banana yields about 70 to 80 t/ha.

Generally, size and 
colour based grading is done.

Post harvest handling and storage: Bananas can be stored for up to a week in a cool place 
but unripe bananas should not be stored in the refrigerator as this may irreversibly interrupt the ripening process.

If the banana is no longer green, then it is ripe and can be stored for a maximum of one week.

For storage, banana should be stored at 13o to 140C."
"Bunches should be kept out of light after harvest since this hastens ripening and softening.

For export, hands are cut into units of 4-16 fingers, graded for both length and girths and carefully placed in poly-lined boxes to hold 12 to 18 kg depending on export requirement.

Prior to packaging fruits are cleaned in water or dilute sodium hypochlorite solution to remove the latex and treated with thiobendazole.

Plastic packaging: Keeping quality of banana can be increased when packed in 400 gauge LDPE 
(Low-Density Poly Ethylene) bags with or without ventilation either under ambient temperature or in a zero energy cool chamber (13.5°C)."
"Storing of banana fruits in unvented polybags at low tem-perature could extend the shelf life of the fruits up to 19.33 days.

Packages of Practices – MANGO
Mango is the most important fruit crop of India."
"India produces about 12.750 Mt of Mango 
from an area of 2.309 Mha with an average productivity of 5.5 mt/ha.

Major producing 
states are Andhra Pradesh, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, West Bengal, Orissa & Maharashtra.

Uttar Pradesh has 0.2712 mha under mango and the total production during 2008-09 is 3.465 Mt with 12.8 mt/ha productivity.

India ranks first in the world for mango production and area under cultivation.

Mango is a rich source of vitamin A and has a fairly good content of vitamin C. Mango fruits are used for preparation of pickle, chatani, amchur, jam, squash, nectar and many other delicious products."
"Climate and soil:  Mango can be grown from alluvial to lateritic soils except black cotton soil 
which has poor drainage.

The temperature between 24 and 270C is ideal for mango cultivation.

Variety:  Dashehari, Langra, Chausa, Bombay Green, Lucknow Safeda, Mallika and Amrapali.

Multiplication of genuine planting material: Mango can be propagated by veneer, wedge 
and soft wood grafting.

The protected nurseries in polyhouses and use of sprinkler and drip is becoming common for raising humidity level, which is required for higher grafting success rate.

Preparation of land: The land should be prepared one month before planting."
"The pits of 1m x 
1m x 1m size are dug.

The pits are exposed for 2 to 4 weeks to kill harmful soil organisms.

Soil sterilization:  Soil sterilization can be achieved through both physical and chemical means.

Physical control measures include steam and solar energy.

Chemical control methods include her -
bicides and fumigants.

Soil sterilization can also be achieved by using transparent plastic mulch film (25 micron thickness) termed as soil solarisation.

Planting:  Square and rectangular systems are popular.

Before planting, pits are filled with FYM 
at the rate of 15-20 kg/plant.

The grafts should be planted during July to September."
"Planting density: High density (3m x 6m or 5m x 5m) planting helps increase the yield/unit 
area.

Normal planting distance of mango is 8m x 8m.

Canopy Management:  Training should be done after 6th month of planting.

It is essential to 
space the branches properly and to help in intercultural operation.

At initial branching height be-tween 60 to 70 cm is appropriate."
"Water requirement of the crop

Farmer’s Handbook on Basic Agriculture
57 MangoApplication of fertilizers:  Mango should be manured with phosphorus twice in a year i.e."
"the 
beginning of the monsoon (June-July) and during the period of post-monsoon (September-Octo-
ber).

Usually fertilizers (N and K) are applied in split doses in the month of June-July, September-October, January-February and March-April.

For adult trees (10 years or above) 1,000g N, 75g P2O5, 75g K2O and 100 kg FYM per year should be applied.

Application of micronutrients such as Zinc and Boron help in cell elongation process.

Malformation: Deblossoming at bud stage (1 cm long) alone or in combination with spray of 
200 ppm NAA lowers the number of malformed panicle."
"Alternate bearing management:  Use of paclobutrazol (5-10g/m canopy diameter), 3 months 
before budburst applied through soil drenching can be used for obtaining regular bearing.

Weed management: Black plastic mulch (100 micron) restricts the germination of weed seeds 
and suppresses the weed growth.

The size of the film requirement for young plant is 1 m x 1 m, and for 8 years onwards film requirement is 2.5 m x 2.5 m around the tree.

Intercropping:  In the interspaces of mango orchard, certain vegetable can be intercropped viz.

onion, tomato, radish, carrot, ginger, turmeric, methi, cabbage, etc."
"Moreover, fruit crops can also be grown viz.

papaya, pineapple, etc.

for the initial 4-5 years.

Mulching: Soil drenching with paclobutrazol (5g and 10g/tree) coupled with black polythene 
mulch (100 micron) results into minimum outbreak of September to October vegetative flushing, giving an early and profuse flowering and a higher annual yield.

Cultivation
Selection of site 
Orchard: Soil should be well drained and of shallow or medium depth.

Deep heavy soils hav-
ing more than 60% clay contents are not suitable for citrus plantation.

Nursery: Nursery 
should be located at least 500 meters away preferably on western side of the orchard to minimize 
incidence of insect pests and diseases.

Raising of citrus nursery 
Sowing of Rootstock Seeds Potting mixture of soil, sand and FYM or compost should be used in equal proportion (1:1:1) for filling of trays in primary nursery and polythene bags in secondary nursery."
"Before it is used for filling the bags/trays, the potting mixture should be solarised.

For solarisation, it is spread on the concrete platform in 4” thick layer in the month of April – May, sufficiently moistened with water, then covered fully with the white polythene sheet, sealing its edges with soil.

Then it should be left undisturbed for 11/2 to 2 months in the hot sun for solarisation.

•	Only certified seeds of rough lemon or Rangpur lime rootstocks should be used."
"•	Shade dried medium size bold seeds of rootstocks should be treated with vitavax or thiram 
 
(@ 3g/kg seed) and sown on the raised beds or in plastic trays during September – October.

•	Stagnation of water in beds should be avoided otherwise roots of young plants may start root-ing.

•	Uniform seedlings of medium height only be selected discarding either vigorous or the weak and dwarf ones while transferring to secondary nursery.

Plants having hooked or bent roots should be discarded.

•	Disease free budgrafts of nagpur mandarin
Plant Protection Measures 
•	Phytophthora infected plants must be eliminated."
"In case of phytophthora infection drenching of plants with either metalaxyl MZ72 @ 2.75 g/l water or fosetyl Al @ 2.5 g/l water should be done.

Second spray should be given after 40 days.

•	To prevent infestation of insect pests like citrus leaf miner and thrips plants should be sprayed either with acetamiprid or thiamethoxam (0.2gm/litre of water) at 10 days intervals.

•	The growth of plants is also affected adversely due to mite attack which can be controlled by spraying plans with Fenazaquin 10% EC @ 4ml/litre and wettable sulfur @ 3 g/l water, alter -

"Manure and fertilizer application
•	Nitrogen containing fertilizers should be applied in three equal splits in January, July and No-vember months; phosphorus containing fertilizers in two splits in January and July months and Potassium containing fertilizers may be applied as singly dose in January.

•	Surveys conducted by NRCC in Kalmeshwar, Katol, Narkhed, Saoner, Hingna and Ramtek tehsils of Nagpur district have revealed N deficiency in most of the orchards and P deficiency in leaf and soil of 50% orchards.

Similarly, leaf and soil K was either at desired levels or even more than it.

Citrus trees are nitrogen loving plants."
"They respond well to the applied ni-trogenous fertilizers.

65Leaf sampling 
For correct diagnosis of nutritional status use of correct sampling technique is very important.

For this, it is important to know as to how many leaves, when, from which part of the plant and from how many trees should be sampled.

In case of ambia bahar, 5-6 month old leaves in August-October and for mrig bahar 6-8 months old leaves in December and February should be sampled."
"As far as possible, the 2nd, 3rd of 4th leaf should be picked from the tip of the non-bearing shoot, preferably at 1.5 – 2 m above the ground and sampled.

Drip irrigation 
With the help of a drip system of irrigation, the required quantity of water can be provided right at the feeder root system.

Similarly, water-soluble fertilizers and micronutrients also can be given through the drip system.

Water requirement of irrigation depends upon age of the tree and season of the year (Table 1).

Mulching with drip irrigation maintains moisture in soil for a longer period."

Weed control 
For effective and economic control of mono and dicotyledonous weeds, pre-emergence weedi-
cides, diuron 3 kg at the end of May and 120 days thereafter should be done."
"For post-emergence weed control, glyphosate @ 4 l/ha should be sprayed on weeds before flowering.

Fruit drop 
Fruit drop in citrus is of serious nature which occurs at least twice; i.e.

the first time when the fruits are little more than the marble size and the second time when the fruits are fully developed or at the time of colour break.

This drop is very serious in the ambia bahar crop pre-harvest fruit drop in 
Nagpur Mandarin66
Soil and Plant Nutrition
Farmer’s Handbook on Basic Agriculture
nagpur mandarin, which is called as pre-harvest fruit drop and is important from economic point 
of view to the orchardists."
"To control the fruit drop that occurs after fruit set, two foliar sprays of either 2,4-D or GA3 at 15 ppm + urea 1% and copper oxychloride
2 (0.3%) at monthly intervals in 
April – May are recommended.

Same spray concentration is recommended for controlling pre-harvest drop in the months of September and October.

2,4-D and GA3 may be dissolved earlier in little quantity (30 – 40 ml for 1g) of some organic solvent such as alcohol or acetone before making the spray solution."
"Control of Insect Pests 
Blackfly (Kolshi): Nymphs of citrus blackfly attack the young flush, suck the sap and excrete 
sweet and sticky liquid, which favours rapid development of black sooty mould that covers entire plant surface.

The process of photosynthesis is hampered greatly resulting in stunted growth of plants, low intensity of flowering, scarce fruiting which are insipid in taste and decline of citrus orchard sets.

For control of blackfly two sprays of insecticides viz.

acetamiprid 0.2 g/litre water should be given at 50% egg hatching stage that normally occurs in the II weed of July and the I week of December and April."
"One additional spray which targets the adult blackfly population 
when it is as its peak helps tremendously in controlling the pest.

Method of spraying: Spraying should be directed at the underside of the leaf, ensuring the 
complete drenching of the tree.

For proper coverage and penetration of canopy, use of power 
sprayers for spraying operation should be envisaged.

Insecticides should be used alternatively for better results.

Citrus psylla: Numerous young brownish nymphs of psylla are seen crawling on the young 
flush.

Several dirty gray colour adults can be seen sitting in line with tails upwards."
"Voluminous desapping by the nymphs results into the drop of flush, flowers and berries.

Affected branches dry and die-back sets in.

The nymphs also excrete white crystalline powder, which invites fungal infestation.

Psylla can be controlled by spraying acetamiprid 0.2 g/litre water twice with 10 days interval during the initial days of flushing.

Bark eating caterpillar (Larva) are incidence of mites on fruits (Lalya).

Leaf miner: Serpentine mines are seen on the new leaves and also young stems are mined when 
the incidence is severe.

At times death of young shoots may occur.

The problem is quite serious in nursery and in young orchard."
"To control citrus leaf miners, spray either imidacloprid 5 ml (To be used in proper doses under guidance of an agriculture expert) and thiamethoxam 0.2g/litre water.

Bark eating caterpillar: The pest is noticed predominantly in the older and ignored orchards.

The hanging wooden frass and tunnel at the joint of two branches during October – April indicates the presence of the pest.

Larva remains hidden inside the tunnel during daytime and becomes active in the night and feeds on the bark nearby the tunnel.

This results into snapping of food sup-ply, ultimately yellowing of leaves on the branch and its slow decline."
"For control of the pest the wooden frass should be cleaned and each tunnel should be administered with Emamectin benzo-ate/spinosad @0.4 ml/litre water.

Fruit sucking moth: The moth attacks the ripening fruits during late hours in the evening.

The 
moth punctures it making a hole in the ripening fruit to suck the juice through which an infection may take place.

Soon rottening starts, leading to fruit drop.

Collection of dropped fruits and their

67destruction followed by smoking of orchard late evening hours is suggested."
"For fruit fly control, 
hanging of methl eugenol (feromone) traps is an effective method to check the pest.

Mites: Citrus rust mites attack in mrig bahar fruits especially during September – November.

The fruit surface, particularly the side exposed to sun, is brushed and develops a big patch of dark brown colour – called ‘Lalya’ – only after 1 to 11/2 months.

To check this, two alternating prophy-lactic sprays at 15-20 days interval with Fenazaquin 10% EC @ 4ml/litre and wettable sulphur @ 3 g/l water are recommended in September – October."
"Similarly, a phytophthora caused gummosis spray of  acetamiprid/thiamethoxam @0.2g/litre water at the berry stage of the ambai fruits is re-quired to protect the fruits from unpleasant scars.

Precautionary measures: Avoid water stagnation in orchard by providing channels along 
the slope for proper drainage.

Moreover, pruning of intermingling branches to allow aeration and sunlight to prevent dampness in orchard are suggested.

Presence of guava, pomegranate, chi-ku, mango trees, etc.

near the orchard act as the alternate hosts for blackfly, therefore, such trees should also be covered with insecticidal sprays."
"Control of Diseases 
Twig Blight: Drying of fruit bearing branches after harvest is a common phenomenon.

Removal 
of such dried shoots along with the 2 cm lower live part, followed by a fungicidal spray i.e.

copper oxychloride or bordeaux paste application is recommended to check twig blight.

Gummosis, root rot and collar rot 
•	Proper diagnosis of the disease is must.

•	Affected trees should be treated with metalaxyl MZ 72 @ 2.75 g or fosetyl AL @ 2.5 g/l water till drenching once in May – June.

The second spray should be given after 40 days.

The tree trunk and soil of the tree basin should also be sprayed/drenched."
"•	Removal of the rotten roots, cleaning the wound on the gum-oozing trunk with sharp knife and then pasting with metalaxyl
3 MZ 72 should be done.

•	Apply bordeaux paste (1 kg CuSO4 + 1 kg CaOH + 10 l water) on tree trunk upto 2 to 21/2 ft  from ground twice i.e.

before monsoon (May) and after monsoon (October).

Precautionary measures•	Avoid flood irrigation 
•	Follow the double ring system of irrigation so that water does not come in contact with the tree trunk.

•	Avoid deep ploughing under the tree to prevent damage/injury of the root system.

This spray remains effective for 3 weeks at normal 
temperatures.

Post-harvest fungicidal treatment: Fruits dipped in fungicidal solution difenoconazole for 
5 minutes are safe to minimize rotting upto 70% and can safely be stored for 3 weeks under normal condition."
"Precautionary measures •	Follow plant protection measures to keep bearing tree disease free and healthy.

•	Post-harvest handling of fruits must be followed carefully to avoid any sort of injury of fruits.

•	Avoid the use of copper fungicides like b,ordeaux mixture, blitox, phytolan etc.

at this stage.

Rejuvenation of declining citrus orchards: Declining citrus orchards can be rejuvenated 
with the use of developed technologies and brought into productive stage.

Harvesting 
•	Traditionally fruits are harvested by twisting and pulling forcefully which may lead to a hole in the neck of the fruit or injury to the stem end."
"The fruits should be selectively harvested when ¾th of the skin turns yellow.

TSS: Acidity ratio should not be less than 14 in both ambia and mrig bahar fruits.

TSS should be at least 10%.

Once this stage is reached, harvesting should not be delayed for colour development since other fruits may turn loose.

•	Fruit should not be allowed to come in contact with soil and straw and also should not be exposed to hot sun.

•	Packing should be done immediately after harvesting.

•	For waxing on a large scale packing line can be used."
"Washing and waxing (stay fresh high shine was 2.5 g + Tebuconazole) and grading of fruits is also done automatically at the end.

•	Graded fruits are packed in corrugated fibre board boxes (50 x 30 x 30 cm) which are telescop-ic with holes on both the sides covering 5% of total side portion.

To keep the fruits safe from moisture in the store house, boxes should be externally laminated with plastic.

•	For small scale (1 – 1.5 tonne) and short duration (20 – 25 days) storage an evaporative cool chamber is recommended, costing Rs.10,000/- to 12,000/-."
"•	For delaying or postponing the harvest of the fruits, two sprays of GA3 (100 mg / 10 litre of water) in 15 day intervals at the point of the colour break are recommended.

•	For long duration cold storage, a temperature of 6-7 0 C and humidity 90-95% is desirable.

In such a situation, citrus fruits should not be stored for more than 45 days.

To avoid chilling injury, care should be taken that the temperature does not go down upto 40 C.

Crop pest and their importance
Pest is any organism which is detrimental to crop 
production."
"Pest cause damage to the plant to 
the extent of 30 - 90 per cent, sometimes it even causes total loss.

Pest includes insects, diseases and weeds.

Non insect pest includes nematodes, snails and rodents.

Insect is any of many small invertebrate animals 
having a segmented body and three pairs of legs and 
usually two pairs of wings.

Some insects are benefi-cial and some are harmful to agriculture.

What is the difference between  
complete and incomplete metamor -
phosis in insects?

Incomplete and complete metamorphosis differs 
in the number of life cycle stages that insects go through during their transformation from egg to adult."
"The complete metamorphosis has 4 life cycle stages and an incomplete metamorphosis has 3 life cycle stages.Complete metamorphosis
Complete metamorphosis has four distinct life cy-cle stages: egg, larva, pupa and adult.

Examples of insects that go through complete 
metamorphosis are butterflies, silkworms, meal-worms and ladybugs.

The larva can be worm-like even though the six legs are still visible.

The larva form moths and butterflies are called caterpillars.

Maggots are the larval stage of flies.

The larvae eat constantly and grow rapidly.

A hard, protective case forms around the larva at pupa stage."
"The pupa stage for a butterfly is called a chrysalis.

The pupa stage for moth is called cocoon.

Incomplete metamorphosis
Incomplete metamorphosis has three life cycle stag-es: egg, nymph and adult.

The nymph looks similar too but is a smaller version of the adult.

The nymph is also wingless.

Examples are grasshoppers, cock-roaches, ants and praying mantids.

"This stage 
is normally seen in the field.

•	 PUPA is an inactive stage preparing itself to de-velop to an adult.

•	Mostly ADULTS insects are harmless but many 
bugs and beetles are harmful to plants.How the damage is visible?

•	The larva eats the leaf, fruits or the whole plant parts.

Hence the damage is visible.

•	Some insects scrape the plant tissues.

They also cut the growing parts.

Beetles, bugs, thrips and hoppers usually suck the sap from the plants and growing parts, affecting the healthy plant.

•	Not at all."

Examples are the trichogramma parasite for sugarcane borers, crub of green lacewing and ladybird beetle.

3.5.

Insect classification
Insects can be classified into 3 groups, depending on their behaviour in the farm such as
•	Pests
•	Beneficial insects
•	Neutral insects
Pest: Whether an insect species is a pest or not 
depends on the situation."
"This means that a cer -
tain insect could be a pest in one situation but not in another situation.

For example, the caterpillars of diamondback moth feed on cabbage and other plants of the cruciferae family.

A farmer who grows cauliflower will therefore consider it a pest.

Y et, for a farmer who grows potatoes or bananas, the dia-mondback moth is a neutral insect.

When there is nothing to feed it will not even occur.

In a paddy crop, black gram is a weed/pest since it is growing unnecessarily.

In a black gram field, cow pea is a weed since it can grow.

Pest will occur only if there is a host."
"Beneficial insects
Some insects are beneficial to the farmer, because they are the natural enemies of harmful insects.

Predators feed on other insects and hence control the pest.

For example, the assassin bug kills caterpil-lars and ladybird beetles feed on aphids.

Some oth-er insects are beneficial as they help in pollination of plants, e.g.

honey bees.

There are commercially beneficial insects such as silkworm, which produces silk.

Neutral insects
A neutral insect is neither a pest nor beneficial.

Y et again, it really depends on the context.

A mosquito in the rice field can be considered as neutral insect.

3.6."
"How to control pest
Natural control
Understanding insect life cycle: Insects mul-
tiply in large numbers.

However the survival rate is very less as the nature maintains insect popula-tion.

Factors like extreme temperature, heavy rains, heavy wind, water stagnation, birds, lizards, spiders, animals, other insects and diseases control the pest.

Natural barriers like sea, river, lake, mountains, etc.

prevent movement and spread of pest."
"Mechanical control: Some of the recommended 
practices are
•	Removal of affected parts 
•	Collection and destruction of insects 
•	Drying of seeds
•	Tar coating of trees to protect from termites 
•	Provision of barriers to prevent the entry of pests like green house / screen house, covering of pomegranate fruits with butter paper, etc.

•	Clipping off the withered shoots
Agronomical methods: Recommended culti-
vation practices are as follows.

•	Summer ploughing:  Opens up the soil and ex-poses pest to hot sun and predators.

•	Trap crop: Is growing the most favoured crop of the insect along with the main crop."
"The insect feeds from the trap crop and the main crop re-mains not unaffected.

Growing of resistant va-rieties also prevents the pest attack.

Main Crop Trap Crop
Tomato Marigold
Cotton Okra, Castor, Onion, Garlic
Maize Sorghum
•	 Mixed cropping: Is growing more than one crop.

•	 Inter cropping: Growing another crop along with main crop, which increases the population of natural enemy.

Main Crop Intercrop
Cabbage Tomato, mustard
Cotton Black gram, green gram
Maize Sorghum
•	 Crop Rotation: Is growing of different crops in74
Plant Protection

sequence instead of one single crop."
"•	 Keeping the fields clean: Managing the weeds 
which provides home for pests, treating the seeds with pesticides, growing the crops in sea-sons where pest incidence is less, application of correct dose of fertilizer at correct time, opti-mum use of water are some of the agronomical methods to control pests.

Pest load and monitoring
Pest monitoring: Is the practice of examining 
the crop to know whether the pest has affected the crop and the extent of damage to decide whether to spray the pesticide or not."
"Economic Threshold Level (ETL): ETL is 
the pest population density at which the control measure has to be taken up to prevent the pest from reaching economic injury level.

ETL for some of the crops are as follows
•	Brown plant hopper in paddy - nymph or adult 
hopper 5-10 / hill 
•	Leaf miner in groundnut: 2 larvae / 10 plant or 20-30% plant infestation
•	Whitefly in cotton: 5-10 adults / leaf or 20 nymphs / leaf
Biological control methods: There are several 
biological agents that controls pest such as
•	The insect that kills another insect by living inside its body is called Parasite.

There is egg, larval and pupal parasites."
"Trichogramma is an egg parasite used commercially on sugarcane borers.

•	Predators are insects that eat other insects.

For example, the Ladybird Beetle, dragonfly, dam-selfly, etc.

Insects are also affected by many diseases.

Some are fungal, bacterial and viral.

Verticillium, a fungal agent, bacillus, a bacterial agent, and NPV (Virus) are commercially used.Physical Control 
•	An age old practice is to mix pulses with red earth to protect pulses from pulse beetle.

•	Drying of seeds in hot sun and using radiation are some of the physical control methods.

Traps
•	 Light Trap: Most of the insects are attracted to-wards light."
"This principle is used to monitor and control pests.

•	 Pheromone Trap:  Insects are trapped using the scent of one sex.

This is commonly used for the control of cotton bollworms.

•	 Y ellow Sticky Traps: Some of the small sucking insects are attracted by yellow colour.

Hence yellow coloured containers smeared with sticky materials are kept inside the field to attract sucking insect.

Chemical control
Manual pesticide spraying 
•	Pesticide application is the last resort to control pests.

•	Pesticides to be selected carefully to control the pests.

•	Dose and spraying equipments should be se-lected carefully."
"•	Get the correct recommendation from the ex-tension worker.

•	Understand the difference between chemical name and trade name.

Trade name is the trader given name but the chemical name is originated based on the chemical ingredient.

Botanicals: are plant origin pesticides like neem 
based formulations.

We can also use neem seed kernal extract or neem oil along with soap as pes-ticides.

Commercial botanicals are available in the market and botanicals can be prepared, which cost less and are eco friendly."

3.7.

Pesticides
Pesticides are the chemicals used to control pests.

The pesticides can be broadly classified into 
three groups based on how they act on insects.

Contact and stomach poison: When insect 
comes into contact or when the insect eats the pesti-cide sprayed parts, it gets killed.

Contact and stom-ach poison is used for controlling larvae that feed on leaves.

Examples include Flubendamide."
"Some of the pesticides derived from plants also have con-tact action, for example pyrethrum, sabadilla, etc.

Systemic poison: When the chemical is sprayed 
on the plant, it is absorbed by the plant and trans-ferred to the entire plant system.

Sucking type of pest like aphids, leafhoppers thrips suck the sap from plants.

This kind of sucking pests can be con-trolled by systemic poison like Imidacloprid (To be used with caution), flubendamide, acetamiprid, thiamethoxam, etc.

1) Fumigant: Forms vapour and acts on breath-
ing system of the insects.

When insects breathe it, they get killed."
"Examples include, hydrogen cyanamide, sulfuryl fluoride, etc.

Insecticides are poisons which cannot be used di-rectly.

They need to be used as per directions given on the container or as per the recommendation of extension workers.

Insecticides are available in dif-ferent forms of which some are:i) Dust (D): Poisons are mixed with gypsum, 
talc or clay so that it can be used in powder form.

There is no need to mix with water.

ii) Wettable Powders (WP/WDP):Mixed with 
dry fillers with sticking agents but these dry 
powders can be mixed with water."
"iii) Granules (G): Dry formulations in which 
poisons are mixed with calcium or gypsum in 
granulated form.

Main merit of this formulation is handling will be easy, it is not carried away by the wind and it is less toxic to plants.

iv) Liquid forms, Soluble Liquids (SL), Emulsifi-
able Concentrates (EC), and Soluble Concentrates 
(SC): Liquid forms of pesticides.

Since the pesti-
cides are directly soluble in water, they are mixed with organic solvents, EC formulations disperse in water easily as they are mixed with emulsifi-ers.

v) Fumigants: are the poisons in gas form."
"Normally it is used to fumigate godowns, grains, 
storage rooms and ships even for rat control.

vi) Poison baits: Poisons mixed with food mate-
rial.

The latter acts as attractants.

Baits are exclu-
sively used to control rats.

As the rats are more sensitive, pre baiting is necessary.

3.8.

Types of chemicals
•	Organochlorines, Organophosphates, Carba-mates, Synthetic Pyrethroids are types of chem-icals which were used before, but are not rec-ommended now.

•	New Molecules: Invention is a continuous pro-cess to identify more effective and less hazardous chemical search for better insect management."
"Examples include Nicotinamides, spinozids, triazoles (Hexaconozole, Propiconozole).

"Some insecticidal materials for 
common household use
Kerosene emulsion
This is a contact insecticide useful against many 
sucking insects.

Finely divide 500 g of ordinary bar soap and dissolve it in 4.5 litres of boiling water.

Cool and add 9 litres of kerosene.

The mixture is then vigorously agitated until the oil is completely emulsified.

The stock solution can be diluted with 15-20 times of water before spraying.Tobacco decoction
This is very effective for controlling aphids infesting vegetable crops.

Tobacco decoction can be prepared by steaming 500 gm of tobacco in 4.5 litres of water for 24 hours."
"Then, 320 gm of ordinary sliced bar soap is dissolved separately in another vessel.

The soap solution is added to tobacco decoction and the stock solution is diluted 6 - 7 times.

Neem seed suspension
This is very effective as a repellent against locusts and grasshoppers.

Kernels of mature neem fruits should be crushed into a coarse powder.

For obtain-ing 0.1% concentration, 1 g of powdered neem seed is required for a litre of water.

The required quantity of the coarse powder should be put in a small bag of muslin cloth and dipped in water contained in a bucket and squeezed till the water becomes light brownish."

Disease 
Disease is an impairment of the normal state 
of a plant that interrupts or modifies its vital 
functions.

All species of plants, wild and cultivated alike are subject to disease."
"Although each species is susceptible to characteristic diseases, these are, in each case, relatively few in number.

The occurrence and prevalence of plant diseases vary from season to season, depending on the presence of the patho-gen, environmental conditions, and the crops and varieties grown.

Some plant varieties are particu-larly subject to outbreaks of diseases.

Disease of crops and their importance 
•	Plant become diseased when it is continuously disturbed by some causal agent including an abnormal process that disrupts the plants.

•	There are more than 80,000 plant diseases."
"•	Diseases reduce the yield of the crops and sometimes lead to disaster e.g.

late blight of po-tato, Panama of banana, etc.

•	Managing outbreak of diseases is challenge to the farmer.

Causes of plant disease
Infectious diseases: caused due to fungi, bacte-
ria, viruses, nematodes, etc.

Non-infectious diseases: caused due to unfa-
vourable extraneous condition such as scorching sunlight, high temperature, moisture stress or defi-ciency of micronutrients, pH, heavy metal toxicity, atmospheric pollution, etc.

3.13."
"The disease cycle
The main events of stages comprising the disease cycle include the following: production and 
dissemination of the primary inoculum, primary infection, growth and development of the patho-gen, secondary infection and over wintering.

The primary inoculum is the part of the pathogen 
(that is, bacterial or fungal spores or fungal myce-lium) that over winters (over-seasons) and causes the first infection of the season, known as primary infection.

In general, the greater the amount of in-oculum and the nearer it is to its host, the greater the potential for a disease epidemic."
"Dissemination refers to the spread or dispersal of 
the pathogen from an inoculum source to a host.

Dissemination can occur by wind, splashing rain, insects, infested pruning tools, infected or infested transplants, and other means.

Spread can occur over short distances within the tree canopy or from distant sources.

Primary infection occurs when the pathogen comes 
into contact with a susceptible host under favour -
able environmental conditions.

Pathogens pene-trate the surface of a plant directly or enter through wounds or natural openings.

Growth and development of a pathogen usually oc-
curs on or within infected plant tissue."
"Secondary infection results from spores or cells 
produced following primary infection or from other secondary infections.

The secondary infec-tion cycle can be repeated many times during the growing season.

The number of cycles is dependent on the biology of the pathogen and its host and the duration of environmental conditions needed for infection.

Over wintering or over seasoning is the ability of 
a pathogen to survive from one growing season to the next.

Pathogens of apple survive the winter in a number of different ways."
"For a plant disease to occur, a susceptible host, a 
pathogen (casual agent), and favourable environ-mental conditions must be present and interact with one another.

If any one of these requirements is not met, a plant disease will not occur.

At pre-sent, our ability to manipulate the environment is limited to only a few practices such as pruning to promote drying, bedding to improve soil drainage, and scheduling of irrigation.

Severe disease out-breaks can be prevented by manipulating the host - through the use of resistant cultivars - and the path-ogen -- through cultural practices and fungicidal or bactericidal sprays.II."

3.15 Concept of Seed Treatment
The concept of seed treatment is the use and 
application of biological and chemical agents 
that control or contain primary soil and seed borne infestation of insects and diseases which pose dev-astating consequences to crop production and im-proving crop safety leading to good establishment of healthy and vigorous plants resulting better yields.

The benefits of seed treatment are as follows:
•	Increased germination
•	Ensures uniform seedling emergence."
"•	Protect seeds or seedlings from early season diseases and insect pests improving crop emer -
gence and its growth.

•	Use of plant growth hormones may enhance crop performance during the growing season.

•	Rhizobium inoculation enhances the nitrogen fixing capability of legume crops, and their productivity.

•	Improved plant population and thus higher productivity.

Nematode management
Nematodes are thread-like roundworms in-visible to the naked eye.

Species parasitic on 
plants attack roots and other plant parts, causing stunting and yield reduction.

Nematode-infected plants are not only weakened but their root systems are more susceptible to secondary infections by fungi or bacteria.

Correct identification is the first step when a nem-
atode problem is suspected.

The second step is to determine whether populations are high enough to threaten the crop."
"Root knot nematodes, the most common pathogenic nematodes in vegetables, can-not penetrate roots when soil temperatures are below 50 degrees F, and will not reproduce when soil temperatures are below 58 degrees F. Their re-productive rate is slower at cooler temperatures, so populations build up more slowly.

Thus, cool sea-son crops are less likely to be damaged.

E.g., early spring potatoes, are rarely damaged by nematodes.

Nematode management practices
Isolation: Once a nematode problem is confirmed, 
affected areas and plants should be isolated because transplants, machinery and irrigation water can all spread nematode infections."
"From initially small-infested areas, nematodes can spread across a field at a rate of 3 feet per year.

Crop rotation and cover crops: Crops suscep-
tible to root knot nematodes include all cole crop species, beans, cucumber, muskmelon, watermelon, bendi, potato, sweet potato and tomato.

All pota-toes are susceptible to nematodes except for a few cultivars resistant to the golden nematode.86
Plant Protection
Farmer’s Handbook on Basic Agriculture
Rotation to non-host crops such as corn, cucurbits, 
potatoes and tomatoes is an effective control for the cyst nematode."
"But is less likely to control the root knot nematode because of its wider host range.

All species of Meloidogyne are called 'root knot' nema-tode but each species has a different host range, causing confusion over which crops or cultivars are resistant or tolerant to which species of root knot nematode.

Rotations to non-host crops for more than a year reduce populations below damaging levels but will not eliminate them.

Cover crops: significantly reduce subsequent 
damage to crop."
"Increasing Soil Organic Matter: Higher soil 
organic matter content protects plants against nem-atodes by increasing soil water-holding capacity and enhancing the activity of naturally-occurring biological organisms that compete with nematodes in the soil.

Fallow Period: A fallow period of two years 
with no susceptible plants in the field decreases nematode populations.

Marigold  as a rotation 
crop suppress nematodes.

Plant resistance: Nematode resistant cultivars 
may be used to reduce the incidence of nematodes
Symptoms
•	Understanding symptom and description of disease will help in identification at field level."
"Some of the disease symptoms are: 
Blast infected leaf of paddy
Bacterial blight of paddy
Altenaria leaf spot of redgram
Wilt affected redgram plant
Red rot in sugarcane
Ratoon stunting in sugarcane
Anthracnose in cotton
Gray mould in cottonPlant Protection

Control measures - Tips for the 
farmers
•	Correct identification of disease in your farm is 
essential for effective control of disease.

•	With little experience, you can identify the dis-ease.

However you can contact agricultural of-ficers of your area along with disease specimen and seek their help in identifying the disease."
"•	Y ou can also give disease-affected plant parts to the Agri clinics for clinical test before under -
taking control measures.

•	Follow Integrated Diseases Management such as host plant resistance, agronomic practices, judicious use of fungicides, pesticides for vec-tor control, bio-pesticides for pathogen control etc., as indicated below.

3.18.

Integrated disease management 
practices in the field
•	Select varieties and hybrids resistant to the 
most common or economically important dis-eases in consultation with agricultural officers of your area.

For  example:
•	Plant only good quality, disease-free seed hav-ing good germination."
"E.g.

Cotton seed hav-ing above 80% germination will have vigorous growth and will not suffer from infection of soil borne diseases
•	Use seed-treatment with fungicides to control diseases.

•	Plant when soil temperature and moisture are most favourable for specific crop.

E.g: If the farmers take up sowing of cotton during the warmer temperature (>65 F), there will be bet-ter germination and growth.•	Avoid planting the same crop in a field year af-ter year.

E.g.

: I) Growing paddy in the Veriticillium wilt in-fested field will reduce the incidence of micro-
bial population in the soil."
"II) Growing Chrysanthemum will inhibit the 
growth of the Veriticillium in the soil.

•	Incorporate the crop residues of the previous crop by tilling well before planting season.

E.g.

Disease affected plants should be burnt imme-diately.

•	Choose right sowing time and maintain ap-propriate plant population by adopting recom-mended spacing.

•	Apply a balanced fertilizers based on a soil test.

E.g.

: Potassium deficiency leads to susceptibil-ity of Alternaria leaf spot.

•	Apply recommended amount of Farmyard Ma-nures/compost at regular intervals and main-tain soil-organic matter content.

E.g."
": Over dose of chemical fertilisers lead to more vegeta-tive growth and more disease.

•	Enrich soil with beneficial micro-organisms like Trichoderma.

•	Keep the land weed free.

Weeds can serve as alternate hosts for pathogens and helps disease development.

•	Timing and duration of irrigation should match the crop and water requirement without allow-ing for excess water.

E.g.

: Excessive irrigation favour soil borne pathogen
•	Maintain insect population below ETL to re-duce the incident of disease transfer by insects.

•	Regular crop monitoring is essential for effec-tive disease management."
"•	Use bio-pesticide as far as possible to control disease.

Chemical may be used only as last re-sort.

"Weed and its relevance in crop 
production 
•	Weeds are the plants, which grow where they 
are not wanted 
•	Weeds compete with crops for water, soil nutri-ents, light and space 
•	Weeds reduce crop yields to the extent of up to 50 percent
•	Critical period of weed competition is approxi-mately 1/3rd of the duration of the crop
Characteristics of weeds: “One year 
seeding, seven years weeding”
•	Produces larger number of seeds compared to 
crops.

E.g."
": Amaranthus retroflexus produces 1,96,405 seeds/plant, whereas wheat & rice pro-duces only 90 to 100 seeds/plant
•	Most of the weed seeds are small in size 
•	Easy and diverse means of seed dispersion 
•	Seeds germinate earlier and grow faster
•	Flower earlier and mature ahead of the crop 
•	Germinate under tough conditions, season bound 
•	Seeds are dormant for long period and germi-nate during suitable season
•	Good viability for years 
•	Tolerate moisture stress
•	Possess stronger and deeper root system
Effect of weed competition on crop 
growth and yield
•	Crop suffers from nutritional deficiency
•	Growth is reduced
•	Water requirement will be more
•	Lowers the input response
•	Pest and disease incidence will be more
•	Yield is affected
•	Cost of production will increase3.20."

"Control measures of weeds
Principles of weed control
•	Prevention
•	Eradication
•	Control
•	Management
a) Preventive weed control
•	Avoid using crop that are infested with weed 
seeds for sowing
•	Avoid adding weeds to the manure pits
•	Nursery or planting material should be free from weeds
•	Keep irrigation channels, fence-lines and un-cropped areas clean
•	Constantly look for weed, destroy the weeds then and there
•	Use good quality certified seeds, which are free from weed seeds 
•	Use pre-emergence herbicides to prevent ger -
mination of weeds
b) Eradication (complete removal): Weeds are 
killed or completely removed from a given area, will not reappear unless it is introduced again."
"However, 
•	It is very difficult
•	Involves high cost
•	Can be used in green houses and nurseries
c) Control: Weeds growth is restricted and killed 
when necessary so that it does not affect crop growth.

d) Weed management: Managing the population 
of weeds using all possible methods.

(i) Mechanical method: 
•	 Tillage: Using plough or disc, weeds are re-moved from soil and exposed to sunlight.

•	 Hoeing:  Using hand hoe, annual and bienni-
als are completely removed.

•	 Hand weeding: Either by physical removal or pulling out of weeds by hand or using some implements.

•	 Digging: Advisable in the case of perennial 
weeds."
"•	 Using sickle: Top portion of weeds are re-moved using sickle, thereby weeds seed pro-duction is controlled.

•	 Burning: Burning is often an economical and 
practical means of controlling weeds but not always possible in crop production field.

•	 Flooding: Kills weeds by reducing oxygen to 
plant growth.

This is possible only under gar -
den land or wetland condition."
"Merits of mechanical method•	Oldest and effective method
•	Safe method for environment
•	High skill is not necessary
•	Weeding is possible in between plants 
•	Deep rooted weeds can be controlled effec-tively
Demerits of mechanical method•	Labour and time consuming
•	Possibility of crop damage 
•	Requires ideal moisture
•	Costly 
ii) Cultural weed control
•	 Summer ploughing: Is done immediately af-ter summer showers.

This exposes weeds to hot sun.

•	 Field preparation: Makes the field weed free by constant removal.

•	 Select crop that can compete better with weeds like cowpea, sudan gross, sorghum are good competitors."
"Fast growing crops sup-presses the weed effectively.

•	 Maintenance of optimum plant population: Adequate plant population covers the land and, hence, growth of the weed will be dif-ficult.

Close row crops are better than wide row.

•	 Crop rotation: Minimize the dominance of 
particular weed in the cropping system.

•	 Growing of intercrops: Inter cropping cov-
ers the land quickly and reduce growth of the weeds.

E.g,: Growing crop such as cow-pea/ soybean, etc.

in wide spaced crops like maize/pigeon pea/sugar cane, etc.

•	 Mulching: Mulch is a protective covering of material maintained on soil surface."
"It has smothering effect and reduces the weed growth.

Mulching can be done through de-gradable farm waste or through plastic sheets.

In case of plastic, black is the most popular colour used in commercial horticulture crop production, especially for weed control.

•	 Solarisation: Done by covering the pre soaked field with transparent polythene cover, which increases the temperature by 5 – 10 ºC.Plant Protection
Farmer’s Handbook on Basic Agriculture
93•	 Stale seedbed: Weeds are allowed to germi-
nate and non-residual herbicide is sprayed to kill the young weed seedlings."
"•	 Blind tillage: Ploughing after sowing of the crop and before plants emerge.

Normally seed drills are used under rainfed condition for this purpose.

•	 Crop management practices: Vigorous and fast growing crop varieties for better compe-tition with weeds."
"Merits of cultural method•	Low cost 
•	Easy to adopt
•	Less technical skill is sufficient
•	No damage to crops
•	Effective weed control
Demerits of cultural method•	Time taking and difficult 
•	Perennial and problematic weeds can not be controlled
iii)  Biological weed control: Natural enemy 
of a weed plant is used to control the weed 
Examples:   
•	Zygogramma biolorata for control of Par -
thenium 
•	Hirsch – Manniella spinicaudata is a rice root nematode to control most upland rice weeds
•	Azolla in rice
Advantages•	Eco friendly
•	Easy
•	Low cost
Disadvantages •	They may have alternate host or switching over to alternate host
•	Multiplication of bio agent in many cases is difficult 
iv)  Chemical Weed Control: Herbicides are 
chemicals used to control weeds."
"Merits
•	Recommended for adverse soil and climatic conditions
•	Applied even before weeds emerge and make the environment weed free
•	Suitable for all types of crops•	Controls the targeted weeds only
•	Controls many perennial weed species
•	Cost effective  compared to labour
Demerits•	Pollutes the environment
•	Affects the soil 
•	Herbicide drift affects adjoining field
•	Requires minimum technical knowledge 
•	Leaves residual effects
•	Some herbicides are costly
•	No suitable herbicides are available for mixed and inter-cropping system

"Precautions while spraying the 
herbicides
•	Select right kind of herbicide for right kind of 
crop and spray.

Any mistake in choosing the herbicide may result in loss of total crop.

•	Dosage should be accurate and good quality of water should be used.

•	Use always correct nozzle for spraying.

Spray-ing should be done from front to backwards.

(We should not step into the sprayed field for a minimum of 3 days).

•	The soil should have sufficient moisture for ef-fective control.

•	For paddy, a thin film of water should be main-tained for 3 days and it should not be drained."

•	Typha and Saccharum sp is used for making ropes and thatch boards.

•	Chicory Cichorium intybus roots are used for adding flavor to coffee powder."
"•	Amaranthus viridis, Chenopodium album and Portulaca sp.

are used as leafy vegetable.

•	Hariyali grass (Cynodon dactylon) and Cenchrus Ciliaris, Dichanthium Annulatum  andEclipta alba weeds of grass land serve as food for animals.

•	Weeds act as alternate host for predators and parasites of insect pests, which feed on the weeds.

For example, Trichogramma chilonis feed upon eggs of caster semi looper, which damage the castor plants.

E.g.

Commelina sp (Copper), Eichornia crassipes (Copper Zinc, lead and cadmium in water bodies."
"•	Several species of weeds like Tephorsia purpu-rea and Croton sparsiflora in South India are used as green manures, whereas Eichornia cras-sipes and Pistia stratiotes are used for compost-ing.

•	Argemone Mexicana is used for reclamation of alkali soils.

•	Some weeds have medicinal properties and used to cure snake bite (Leucas aspera), gastric troubles (Calotropis procera), skin disorders (Argemone mexicana) and jaundice (Phyllan-thus nirur ) and Striga Orobanchioides to con-trol diabetes.

•	Agarbathis (Cyperus rotundus), aromatic oils, (Andropogan sp & Simbopogon sp) are pre-pared from weeds."
"•	Air pollution determined by wild mustard and chickweed respectively.

•	Aquatic weeds are useful in paper, pulp and fiber industry.

•	Chenopodium album is used as mulch to re-duce evaporation losses, whereas Agropyron repens (quack grass) is used to control soil ero-sion because of its prolific root system.

•	Weeds like Lantana camara, Amaranthus vir -
idis, Chenopodium Albu and Eichhornia cras-sipes are used for beautification.•	Agropyron repense are used for soil conserva-tion, whereas Dicanthium Annulatum are used as stabilizing field bunds.

Farm Management
What is a farm?

Farm is a socio economic unit.

It is composed of farm family, farm enterprises and structures.

Farmer is a grower cum manager."
"The farmer has to decide how much land, labour, capital and type of technology to use to produce in a given season.

Ultimately, the farmer has to earn a profit to sup-port his livelihood.

What will the farmer do in farm man-
agement?

The farmer would efficiently use the available re-
sources to increase profits through deciding among the best alternatives available.

Some basic functions of farm manage-
ment 
The farmer performs following basic functions to 
effectively manage the farm:
Diagnosis: Analysis of past performance of farm, 
its weakness/strengths."
"Planning: Planning for the future crops/animals 
considering the opportunities and threats.Implementation: Efficient implementation with 
least cost.

Monitoring: Reduce the losses and increase the 
profits by reducing the costs and choosing better technologies based on the observed opportunities.

Evaluation: Evaluating the actions for repeating 
the succeses in future.

What will happen if the farmer does 
not do farm management?"
"In the absence of good farm management, the 
farmer may experience losses in farming for the fol-lowing the reasons:
•	There is continuous changes in supply and price of agri inputs like seeds, fertilizers, irrigation, power etc.

•	There is continuous change in prices of the pro-duce (outputs) in the market due to demand and supply changes."
"•	There is continuous change in the farm tech-nologies.Module 1: Is farming a business?100
Farm Management
Farmer’s Handbook on Basic Agriculture
Therefore the objectives of farming as a 
business are: 
•	How to choose best variety/crop/cropping pat-
tern
•	How to minimise input cost by judicious use 
•	How to increase the production and productiv-ity
•	How to enhance the quality
•	How to plan market driven production
•	Choosing the better source of finance and bet-ter avenues for investment
•	Efficient risk management
For better farm management, the farm-
er should have thorough knowledge of the following aspects: 
•	Farm map
•	Soil slope and topography
•	Soil type (physical and chemical properties)
•	Soil colour such as red soil or black soil
•	Weather parameter such as rainfall, tempera-
ture, relative humidity, etc."
"•	Vegetative cover such as trees, weeds, etc.

•	Irrigation potential from borewell/tubewell/nala/channels
•	Drainage facilities - whether water gets logged or not
•	Technology available and whether the farmer can access  them easily
•	Risk factors like hand loans and high rate of in-terest
•	Market facilities - whether they are near to his 
farm or far off
•	Communication facilities like cell phone and 
internet connectivity
•	Physical and infrastructure facilities such as godowns, roads for transport, vehicles, custom hiring centers, etc."
"•	Whether a farmer can afford the crop/animal he/she wishes to grow or rear considering the above conditions
•	Supporting programmes and schemes/subsi-dies
Farmers should maintain farm records 
to have a holistic knowledge of their production system For example: If a farmer maintains a record for all 
the cost of production such as inputs, labour, etc.

for the entire crop cycle along with yield and in-come obtained from selling the produce, he/she can compare with the next crop cycle to understand whether his/her profit increased or decreased."
"The records also provides information on activities which contributed for his/her profit or loss so that, the farmer can take alternative decisions to enhance his/her net income."
"Farm Resources: To make good farm manage-
ment decisions, farmers need some basic knowl-edge on farm resources such as the extent of land available for cultivation, source of irrigation, family labour, availability of labour, skill level of labours, livestock, availability of fodder, availability of farm 
machinery, availability of inputs such as seeds 
and fertilizers, credit requirement and availability, source of credit, market demand for produce, in-
frastructure such as cold storage and godowns.

etc."
"For example, regarding manpower and livestock the farmers have to understand following issue:
Man Power
•	 Skill:  Is the labour employed is skilled, e.g.

cot-
ton picking skill?

•	 Knowledge: Does the farmer/labour have a 
thorough knowledge of the package of practices of the crop?

•	 Attitude: Does he/she have a positive attitude towards the technology?

Live Stock
•	 Breed: Selection of a suitable breed 
•	 Production capacity: For instance, milk produc-tion, meat production and egg laying capacity.

•	 Adaptability: Does the selected breed adapt to the local situation?

•	 Drafting capacity: Knowledge on the draught capacity of animal."
"•	 Resistance: Is the foreign breeds resistant to lo-cal Indian conditions.

E.g.

the Holstein Fresian is highly sensitive to high temperatures.

•	 Feeding habit: Are the upgrade breeds or im-ported breeds capable of feeding on locally available feed materialsFarm Management

Important Lesson
To DO successful farm business, the farmer must be well aware of prices (of inputs and produce) at dif-
ferent markets."
"This allows the farmer to plan production as well as make decisions on the purchase of 
inputs and the sale of produce.Module 2: Know your farm resources
FARM PLANNING: Farm planning is to help 
the farmers to move to a higher level of production and income, starting from where he/she is now with the resource available to him/her.

In this process, the farmer has to consider different types of enter -
prises like: 
•	Land based (agril.

production activities, pisci-culture, plantation, seed production, etc.

)•	Animal component based (diary, poultry, goat-ery, piggery, duckery, etc.)"
"•	Nursery/orchard
•	Non-land based (mushroom, apiculture, ver -
miculture, etc.)

In the present example, three crops namely paddy, cotton and maize have been taken into comparison Module 3: Manage your farm for enough income to 
sustain yourself102

for one season."
"With these three crops, farmers can 
grow the following combinations in a year: •	Paddy – Paddy (Kharif followed by Rabi)
•	Paddy – Maize (Kharif followed by Rabi)
•	Cotton – Maize (Kharif followed by Rabi)
•	Maize – Maize (Kharif followed by Rabi)

* It proves that Paddy after Paddy realises the highest profit throughout the year followed by Cotton – Maize."
"Paddy – Cotton is not feasible.Remember: Even if Paddy after Paddy promises the highest profit throughout the year, farmer should avoid continuous monocropping to ensure soil fertility through crop diversification and rotation to realize sustained profitability of their farm.

Main Lessons
•	To know if you are doing successful business with a crop, you need to know the “Income” and “Expenditure” accurately.

•	The farmer records the inputs & labour used in a field, and calculates the “Income” and “Ex-penditure”
•	From the “Income” the farmer subtracts the Expenditure.

The result indicates whether farm is making profit or loss."
"•	The farmer makes a PROFIT  or GOOD  BUSINESS  if the “Income” is greater than the “Ex-
penditure.

” 
•	It is a LOSS , if the “Expenditure” is greater than the “Income.

” In that case it is BAD  BUSINESS.

•	A loss is illustrated by the the minus (dash) and a profit by the plus in front of the number.

•	A good farmer will abandon loss making crop or use a better technique to make a profit.

•	To ensure a profit, the farmer needs to visualise Income and Expenditure before production.

•	The Difference between Income and Expenditure indicates whether we are making a loss or profit from the use of the land."
"•	The Unit Cost of a crop indicates if it can compete with the same crop produced elsewhere.

In the case of food crops, the Unit Cost indicates if it is preferable to buy the produce in the market.

•	The good farmer calculates well ahead of the season to decide what to produce and which techniques to use.

•	During the production season the good farmer keeps records on money spent for farm opera-tions and inputs."
"•	After the harvest, the good farmer evaluates the profit and identifies what changes are needed to improve the planning and profit for the next production seasonFarm Management

115What are Fixed Costs?

Certain costs are called fixed costs.

These are costs for equipment and tools that the farmer owns and 
are used for various crops over several years, such as sprayers, irrigation pumps, buildings etc.

The 
Fixed Costs do not vary with the size of the field."

* As the income is realised only during May and November, the monthly balance is shown as negative 
which indicates that the farmers raises a hand loan/personal loan or shall keep the gross income (Rs 81,400 
X 2 = 162,800) and spend through out the year based on the need."
"Note: In this example all produce from the farm is sold as per the prevailing market rates.

The profit of the 
farmer depends on the price for the produce i.e., whether the Minimum Support Price (MSP) or market rates are prevailing - which are both fluctuating.

Third Step: 
Fill the second financial calendar.

The expenditures for inputs and labour are those from the exercise Sheets in Module 5 – using improved practices.

Fourth Step: 
Discuss the differences and which situation is preferable.

What changes are necessary?

Main Lessons
•	In the agricultural enterprise, expenditure for the farm and the household are incurred every month."
"But the revenue comes only after sale of produce.

Therefore there are months of the year where the expenditures are greater than the revenues.

These months are called “deficit m o n t h s .”
•	For this reason, the good farmer makes a financial calendar.

The farmer plans expenditures for production and household needs in consultation with his spouse.

•	To be able to cover the expenditures in deficit months, the good farmer saves money from the sales of produce (“surplus months”).

•	Improved techniques may contribute to improve the revenues of the farmer."
"•	The needs for inputs can be identified with calculations of gross margin and the financial cal-endar.

This information can be used to make savings in a targeted way or to solicit credit for production.

•	The above calculations are done for a farmer with one hectare for Paddy – Paddy combination in Kharif and Rabi for one year.

The same exercise should be repeated for taking farm manage-ment decisions for the combinations such as
•	Cotton – Maize (Kharif – Rabi)
•	Paddy – Maize (Kharif – Rabi)
•	Maize – Maize (Kharif – Rabi)
Risk in Agriculture
The farmer does not like risks because they are difficult to predict."
"However, he/she can determine the risk during the planning so that the impact on revenues could be minimised.

For example, Module 4 
indicates income and expenditure of paddy, maize and cotton.

With available data, Paddy - Paddy is the best preferred cropping pattern.

However, the farmer can make a judicious decision taking prevailing and anticipated risks into considerations.

The anticipated risks and possible decisions are as follows:
Anticipated Risks Remarks
Reduction in Paddy Market price by 10% Cotton – Maize is preferred
Inadequate water due to drought for Paddy - Paddy Cotton – Maize is preferred followed by Maize - Maize."
"Quantity of water available decides the cropping pattern.Farm Management
Farmer’s Handbook on Basic Agriculture
119Anticipated Risks Remarks
Lack of capital for investment for Paddy – Paddy or 
Cotton - MaizePaddy and Maize is preferred followed by Maize - Maize
Serious pest problems in Cotton Paddy – Paddy is preferred 
Main Lessons
•	Comparing the gross margins of different crops and the production techniques, helps to make decisions on using the land to maximise revenue.

This comparison is important to all agricul-tural entrepreneurs."
"•	Comparing the labour productivity helps to identify the crops and techniques that make best use of labour (family or wage labour).

It also indicates if it is profitable to work on your own farm.

•	Comparing the capital productivity indicates which crops or production techniques make best use of money invested.

•	Production decisions are based on these comparisons.

•	The good agricultural entrepreneur knows that a fluctuation in prices constitutes a risk and revenues.

Risks are concern for traditional as well as improved varieties and techniques."
"•	To evaluate the impact of this market risk, the entrepreneur calculates estimated the gross margin with a much lower price (pessimistic) than the current price (or last season’s price).

If the pessimistic gross margin estimate can still satisfy the revenue objectives, then the risk is acceptable.

•	To evaluate the impact of production risks, the agricultural entrepreneurs calculates a gross margin using a yield lower (pessimistic) than expected.

If the pessimistic gross margin esti-mate can still satisfy the revenue objectives, then the risk is acceptable.Occupational Health and Safety

ous occupational hazards, especially more caused due to handling of chemicals and machineries."
"Be-
sides, natural hazards are caused due to snakebite, wild animal attack, etc.

Knowledge on preventive and curative aspects of these occupational hazards would reduce risks and ensure the safety to the farmers.5.

"Factors that may increase risk of 
injury or illness for farm workers
Age:  Injury rates are highest under 15 and over 65 
years of age.

Equipment and machinery: Most farm acci-
dents and fatalities involve machinery.

Proper ma-
chine guarding and regular equipment maintenance according to manufacturers’ recommendations can help prevent accidents.

Non-availability of protective equipments: 
Using protective equipment, such as seat belts on tractors and personal protective equipment (such as safety gloves, cover alls, boots, hats, aprons, goggles and face shields) could significantly reduce farming injuries."
"Lack of medical care: Hospitals and emergency 
medical care are typically not readily accessible in rural areas near farms.

However, the farmers may utilize for example 108 mobile medical emergency services during emergencies.

Socio - economic risks
•	There are dangers due to indiscriminate pes-ticide/weedicide application to soil, water, air, food chain, natural enemies of pest, resistance of pest, etc.

•	Pesticides are hazardous, so there will be asso-ciated risk and impact of risk on social system including economic damage.

So there should be a proper understanding on hazards of pes-ticides."
"Effects on human beings
•	Pesticides accumulate in fatty tissues and re-productive cells lead to birth defects, abnor -
malities, abortions, premature deliveries, etc.

•	Farm workers who regularly spray pesticides are susceptible to impaired eyesight.

•	The liver is particularly susceptible to damage by chlorinated hydrocarbons, which can lead to higher risk of serious infection.

Environmental exposures lead to
•	Air pollution
•	Soil and water pollution
•	Food contamination
Looking into the implications of pesticides on so-cio-economic dimensions, use of pesticides should be judiciously planned only in critical situations with utmost care."
"Management of pest below Eco-nomic Threshold Level (ETL) is most desirable.

5.6.

Safe handling of agro chemicals
Agro chemicals are widely used in agriculture, which are major source of health hazards to 
farmers.

Important tips to farmers for safe use of agro chemicals are as follows:Occupational Health and Safety
Farmer’s Handbook on Basic Agriculture
123Buying pesticides 
Before buying think over this
•	Which pest is to be controlled?

•	Is damage crossing threshold level requiring 
pesticide use?

•	Do not wash the used containers in commu-nity water sources.

Colour Coding of pesticides: The colour band on the pesticide container indi-cates the hazard level of pesticides."
"While han-dling pesticides farmers should take colour band into consideration.•	Red – Very toxic to toxic
•	Y ellow – Harmful
•	Blue - Moderately hazardous
•	Green - Acute hazard unlikely in normal use
5.7.

First aid measures for pesticide 
poisoning
•	In case of skin contact, remove contaminant 
contacts and wash with clean water.

•	In case of inhalation, remove from site and provide good clean air site, keep the head and shoulder upright.

•	In case of unconscious and breathing stops, provide artificial respiration.

"Give milk after that.124
Occupational Health and Safety
Farmer’s Handbook on Basic Agriculture
•	Take the patient to doctor at the earliest.

•	Take the container along with patient to consult 
doctor.

Snake and other animal bites or attacks 
and precautions
Snakebite is a routinely occurring life threatening 
emergency in India."
"The mortality and morbidity 
associated with the diverse presentation of snake-
bites can be decreased if a proper history of the patient’s background and habits combined with a thorough knowledge of the specific features of the regional snakes are kept in mind.Physical and mental drudgery
To reduce drudgery related to hard work in differ -
ent agricultural operations, several technologies for land preparation, weeding, pesticide application and various other farm works have been developed including farm machinery which need to be used by the farmers to keep themselves fit and healthy."
"Farmers are advised to contact local extension functionaries and scientists to obtain information on such drudgery reducing farm machineries.

5.8.

Care in use of pesticides by 
farmers 
Useful tips for safe use of pesticides by farm-ers are:
•	Identify the pest and ascertain the damage done.

•	Use pesticide only if it has exceeded the economical injury level.

•	Use only the recommended pesticide, which is the least toxic.

•	Read instructions manual of the pesticide and equipment.

•	Check the spraying equipment and accessories, which are to be used."
"•	Ascertain that all components are clean, especially filling and suction, 
strainer, sprayer tank, cut off device and nozzle

Safety tips to reduce the risk of 
injuries and fatalities while handling machineries
Contrary to the popular image of fresh air and 
peaceful surroundings, a farm is not a hazard 
free work setting.

Every year, thousands of farm workers are injured and hundreds die in farming accidents.

Safety in agriculture is one of the main concern, especially  when handling with farm tools and machinery.

Many accidents in agriculture go unnoticed because they will not be reported.

So learning from mistakes will be less."
"Safety tips to reduce the risk of injuries and fatalities while han-dling machineries are as follows:
•	Safety can be improved on farm by increasing awareness of farming hazards and making a conscious effort to prepare for emergency situ-ations including fires, vehicle accidents, elec-trical shocks from equipment and wires and chemical exposures.

•	Be especially alert to hazards that may affect children and the elderly.

•	Minimize hazards by carefully selecting the products to ensure safety.

•	Always use seat belts when operating tractors.

•	Read and follow instructions in equipment op-erator’s manuals and on product labels."
"•	Inspect equipment routinely for problems that may cause accidents.

•	Discuss safety hazards and emergency proce-dures with all concerned.

•	Take precautions to prevent entrapment and suffocation caused by unstable surfaces of grain storage bins and silos.

Never “walk on the grain.

” 
•	Be aware that methane gas, carbon dioxide, ammonia and hydrogen sulfide can form in un-ventilated grain silos and manure pits and can suffocate or poison farmers or explode."
"•	Wear clothing that fits well and is not loose fit-ting to avoid being caught in pinch points.128
Occupational Health and Safety
Farmer’s Handbook on Basic Agriculture
•	Never reach over or work near unguarded ro-
tating parts.

•	Turn off machinery to attend to repairs.

•	 Always replace shields that were removed 
for maintenance.

•	Plug unused or failed borewell pits
•	Check all equipment for potential w.rap points (e.g.

where clothing or hair could be wrapped around a shaft) and if possible, shield those points."
"•	Replace any damaged manufacturer installed warning labels and place warnings on equip-ment parts not previously labeled (consider painting them with a bright color, perhaps with a wide stripe).

•	Stay alert and warn others when working with shear and cutting points (e.g.

objects with blades or hard edges used to cut).

Some shear and cutting points cannot be guarded, which can result in severe cuts, lost limbs or injuries from objects thrown by the cutting type equip-ment.

•	Wait until a tractor has stopped completely be-fore stepping into the hitching position.

•	Never touch free-wheeling parts (i.e."
"parts that continue to spin after the power is shut off) un-til they have stopped moving.

This could take 2-2½ minutes.

•	Be aware of burn points: mufflers, manifolds and even gear cases.

•	Hydraulic systems contain fluid under extreme pressure.

Before loosening, tightening, remov-ing or otherwise working with any fittings or parts, relieve this pressure (shut off the hy-draulic pump, lower implements and follow instructions in the operator’s manual).

•	Keep equipment in good repair and safety fea-tures up to date.

•	“Proper machine inspection and maintenance can help prevent accidents” ."
"•	When it comes to machinery maintenance, a shield and guard to cover spinning parts or blades should be kept in place.

•	Follow the one seat, one rider rule.

If there is only one seat on the equipment, there should only be one rider – an adult.

•	Don’t allow children to play or ride on equip-ment or in areas where machinery is used or stored.

•	Under aged children should not operate 2, 3, and 4 wheeled vehicles.•	Do not allow riders or passengers in the back of pickup trucks.

•	Before starting machinery, all operators should know where kids are located."
"Y ou may be un-able to hear or see children, especially behind large wheels or in blind spots.

•	All equipment should be parked and locked with the keys removed when not in use.

•	Keep hand tools out of reach of children, espe-cially those with sharp or hot parts.

Better safety and health practices reduce farmer fa-talities, injuries and illnesses as well as associated costs such as workers’ compensation insurance premiums, lost production and medical expenses.

A safer and more healthy workplace improves mo-rale and productivity."
"First aid for accidents: The farmers injured 
should be given first aid at the earliest in order to reduce the damage caused by the injuries.

Impor -
tant tips are as follows:
•	The treatment should be given from a person trained in basic first aid, using supplies from a first-aid kit.

•	Medical treatment and care given at the site of any medical emergency or while transporting any victim to a medical facility.

•	Make sure that first-aid trained personnel are available to provide quick and effective first-aid.

Alternatively, one of the family members should be trained."
"•	Make sure first-aid supplies at your workplace are appropriate to your occupational setting.

The response time of your emergency medical services is very important.

•	Good knowledge about locally available anti-dotes or medicinal plants, which can be used.

•	Keep the first aid kit(s) in the work place.

•	Keep clean water in the work place.

•	Keep mobile numbers of trained person on first aid, ambulances, local hospital, local doc-tors and vehicle owners in the near by vicinity.

Important services required for 
farmers 
•	Information 
•	Inputs (seed, fertilizer, pesticide, machinery, 
etc.)

•	Infrastructure (cold storage, godown, feed mix-ing unit, etc.)

•	Market (market yard, market intelligence, transport, etc.)"
"•	Developmental schemes/programmes
•	Credit and insurance, etc.

The above services are needed with dimensions of accessibility, quality, cost effectiveness and timeli-ness.

Information is the critical input required for 
the farmers to bring about changes starting from selection of crops till the marketing.

Past experience: The most important source of in-
formation to the farmers is his/her past experience itself.

However before acting upon information based on past experience, he/she needs to cross check the relevance to the present context."
"Progressive farmers: are the small segment of rural life who are socially, economically and technologi-
cally advanced compared to other farmers.

They go in search of advanced technologies proactively, adopt and harvest the benefit of technologies.

They are the nearest and easiest source of agricultural in-formation to other farmers.

For example, contact farmers, award winning farmers, Block Farmers Advisory Committee (BFAC) members, District Farmers Advisory Committee (DFAC) members, State Farmers Advisory Committee (SFAC) mem-bers, farmers running farm school, etc."
"Input Dealers: are mostly village level businessmen 
who sell seeds, fertilizers, pesticides and machiner -
ies to the farmers.

Also provides extension adviso-ries by their strength of proximity to the farmers.

However maximum precautions has to be exercised for accessing the advisory services as they are not professionally qualified extension functionaries.

However, some input dealers are trained through various programme like Diploma in Agricultural Extension Service for Input Dealers (DAESI) who can provide quality agricultural information."
