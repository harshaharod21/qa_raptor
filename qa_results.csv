By incorporating organic matter into the soil, INM strategies also enhance soil structure, water retention, and microbial activity, leading to healthier soil ecosystems. This balanced approach not only supports the efficient use of resources but also minimizes the environmental impact of farming by reducing dependency on chemical fertilizers, thereby promoting agricultural sustainability."
